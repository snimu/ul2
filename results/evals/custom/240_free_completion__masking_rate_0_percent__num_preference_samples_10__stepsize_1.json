Among the most popular is the assumption that a fort was present here on the shore of the Ottawa River to keep provisions at the portage. It has been claimed that a fort called Dufort was flooded in the rapids at this location. However, some researchers argue that the fort in question has never existed and may be a reference to another fort at the mouth of the Coulonge River (after which modern Fort-Coulonge is named). Moreover, the word formerly did not always convey a military connotation and could be more or less synonymous with a village or hamlet, or even a post or warehouse which was fortified.[1]\n\nOne theory suggests that the name goes back to a custom of the Algonquins who would paint their bodies here and it was originally named Portage du Fard (French for \"make-up\"), which changed into \"Fort\".[1]\n\nAnother possibility is that Fort (French also for \"strong\") makes reference to the strength needed to haul the heavy canoes and supplies\"": {

However, it does make some references to territories, albeit incorrectly and unclearly. Completion 1 suffers from repetitiveness and lack of clarity. Overall, neither completion is satisfactory, but Completion 2 is a bit less incoherent than Completion 1, as it at least tries to relate to territories, albeit poorly.

Rock firefinches fall in the family Estrildidae, which contains small passerine birds of the Old World and Australasia. Rock firefinches seem to be most closely related to Mali firefinches and Chad firefinches.[2] The species name sanguinodorsalis means blood-red back, which was chosen because it describes the vibrant red back color of the male plumage.[2] The status of the species is evaluated as Least Concern.\n\nDescription\nRock firefinches are sexually dimorphic, where adult males have more brightly colored plumage than adult females.[3] Males are characterized": {

They may have been collected by an English scholar while travelling on the continent sometime after the last datable song (1039), and brought back with him to the church of Saint Augustine at Canterbury, where they were copied and where the Codex was long kept. The original manuscript was possibly lost in a fire that struck Saint Augustine's in 1168. The dialect of the few vernacular portions found in some of the songs is in the North Rheno-Franconian dialect of Old High German, suggesting that the Goliard or Goliards who composed them came from the north or middle Rhineland, probably the area between Trier, Cologne, and Xanten.

Zimmerman. They had three children. He attended North Central College, Northwestern University and the University of Wisconsin Law School. During World War II, he served as an officer in the United States Navy. He was also active in his local Methodist church, serving as a lay speaker.\n\nPolitical career\nGuell was a member of the Assembly from 1957 to 1958. He also made an unsuccessful run for the Assembly in 1960.[2] Guell was a Republican.[2]": {

  "Joseph Cornell began to collect films on 16mm in the 1920s, mainly to entertain his mother and disabled brother at the family home in Queens, where Cornell lived for two thirds of his life. To vary the program and to surprise his family, Cornell began to alter his films slightly by adding shots, or changing the endings to films with which they were familiar. This led, in time, to his first and most elaborate film collage, Rose Hobart (1936), coincidentally concurrent with his first box, Soap Bubble Set (1936), later sold to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Recently discovered correspondence between Cornell and Iris Barry of MoMA's film library reveals that he was already conversant with language relevant to the then emerging field of film preservation and was also occasionally collecting films in 35mm nitrate.[5]": {

  "Pietro Paolo Agabito or Agabiti (c1470-c1540) was an Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor, and architect from the Marche region. His style is rather provincial, and most surviving works are in the churches and museums of the region. He may have trained with Carlo Crivelli, and among the artists generally credited with having influenced his style are the Venetians Cima da Conegliano and Alvise Vivarini, the Bolognese artist Francesco Francia and Marco Palmezzano of Forl\u00ec. However, Agabiti did not keep up with the changes of style occurring in the early sixteenth century, remaining attached to the more formal style of the fifteenth century.": {
