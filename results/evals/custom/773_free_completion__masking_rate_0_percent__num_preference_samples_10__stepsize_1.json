  "Linton was the eldest son of Jabez Linton of Hardrigg Lodge, Dumfriesshire, by Jane, daughter of William Crocket of Grahamshill in the same county. He was born in 1801 at Kirkpatrick Fleming. He was educated at Edinburgh University, and graduated L.R.C.S. in 1826. But he had already utilised four summer vacations as surgeon on a whaler in the arctic regions. He entered the army medical department in 1826, graduated M.D. at Glasgow in 1834, and became staff surgeon of the first class in 1848. After serving in Canada, the Mediterranean, and the West Indies, he was appointed deputy inspector-general of hospitals of the first division of the army in the Crimea, was present in every action up to the battle of Balaclava, and had care of the barrack hospital in Scutari shortly after its establishment in 1854 until the British forces": {

Among the most popular is the assumption that a fort was present here on the shore of the Ottawa River to keep provisions at the portage. It has been claimed that a fort called Dufort was flooded in the rapids at this location. However, some researchers argue that the fort in question has never existed and may be a reference to another fort at the mouth of the Coulonge River (after which modern Fort-Coulonge is named). Moreover, the word formerly did not always convey a military connotation and could be more or less synonymous with a village or hamlet, or even a post or warehouse which was fortified.[1]\n\nOne theory suggests that the name goes back to a custom of the Algonquins who would paint their bodies here and it was originally named Portage du Fard (French for \"make-up\"), which changed into \"Fort\".[1]\n\nAnother possibility is that Fort (French also for \"strong\") makes reference to the strength needed to haul the heavy canoes and supplies\"": {

  "The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon. It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 29,000 km2. The rock firefinch was discovered recently, in 1998. Rock firefinches fall in the family Estrildidae, which contains small passerine birds of the Old World and Australasia. Rock firefinches seem to be most closely related to Mali firefinches and Chad firefinches.[2] The species name sanguinodorsalis means blood-red back, which was chosen because it describes the vibrant red back color of the male plumage.[2] The status of the species is evaluated as Least Concern.\n\nDescription\nRock firefinches are sexually dimorphic, where adult males have more brightly colored plumage than adult females.[3] Males are characterized": {

They may have been collected by an English scholar while travelling on the continent sometime after the last datable song (1039), and brought back with him to the church of Saint Augustine at Canterbury, where they were copied and where the Codex was long kept. The original manuscript was possibly lost in a fire that struck Saint Augustine's in 1168. The dialect of the few vernacular portions found in some of the songs is in the North Rheno-Franconian dialect of Old High German, suggesting that the Goliard or Goliards who composed them came from the north or middle Rhineland, probably the area between Trier, Cologne, and Xanten.

  "Corwin Carl Guell (December 22, 1909 \u2013 December 1976) was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly.\n\nBiography\nGuell was born Corwin Carl Guell on December 22, 1909, in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.[1] He was later a resident of Thorp, Wisconsin,[2][3] where he worked as an attorney.[4] In 1932, he married Anna L. Zimmerman. They had three children. He attended North Central College, Northwestern University and the University of Wisconsin Law School. During World War II, he served as an officer in the United States Navy. He was also active in his local Methodist church, serving as a lay speaker.\n\nPolitical career\nGuell was a member of the Assembly from 1957 to 1958. He also made an unsuccessful run for the Assembly in 1960.[2] Guell was a Republican.[2]": {

This led, in time, to his first and most elaborate film collage, Rose Hobart (1936), coincidentally concurrent with his first box, Soap Bubble Set (1936), later sold to the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

Three of the Clay children (Bartley, Tabitha, Ezekial) were killed by a band of natives; Mitchell Clay led a group of settlers in bloody retaliation, killing several natives. In the 1920s, businessman Conley T. Snidow purchased the site of the Clay farm for development as an amusement park. At least six amusement patrons were killed while the park was in operation; a little girl on the circling swing set was hit after a truck backed into the path of the swing, and a boy drowned in the amusement park's swimming pond. The park's structures and rides are still standing, abandoned and in disrepair. Tours are offered in the days leading up to Halloween, in which the site is described as being \"cursed\" or \"haunted\".[2]": {
