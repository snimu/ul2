  "Kirkman intended Freedom Ring to be an example of a superhero who demonstrated inexperience with his superpowers, as he felt that most superheroes quickly adjusting to their powers and having a successful superhero career did not reflect reality. When asked by a fan about the number of visibly gay comic book superheroes, Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics, Joe Quesada, also toutedPortage-du-Fort is named after the portage trail which started here and would lead upstream around a set of falls on the Ottawa River.\n\nHowever, there are several hypotheses to explain the \"Fort\" portion. Among the most popular is the assumption that a fort was present here on the shore of the Ottawa River to keep provisions at the portage. It has been claimed that a fort called Dufort was flooded in the rapids at this location. However, some researchers argue that the fort in question has never existed and may be a reference to another fort at the mouth of the Coulonge River (after which modern Fort-Coulonge is named). Moreover, the word formerly did not always convey a military connotation and could be more or less synonymous with a village or hamlet, or even a post or warehouse which was fortified.[1]\n\nOne theory suggests that the name goes back to a custom of the Algonquins who would paint their bodies here and it was originally named Portage du Fard (French for \"make-up\"), which changed into \"Fort\".[1]\n\nAnother possibility is that Fort (French also for \"strong\") makes reference to the strength needed to haul the heavy canoes and supplies\"": {

  "The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon. It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 29,000 km2. The rock firefinch was discovered recently, in 1998. Rock firefinches fall in the family Estrildidae, which contains small passerine birds of the Old World and Australasia. Rock firefinches seem to be most closely related to Mali firefinches and Chad firefinches.[2] The species name sanguinodorsalis means blood-red back, which was chosen because it describes the vibrant red back color of the male plumage.[2] The status of the species is evaluated as Least Concern.\n\nDescription\nRock firefinches are sexually dimorphic, where adult males have more brightly colored plumage than adult females.[3] Males are characterized": {

  "The Cambridge Songs (Carmina Cantabrigiensia) are a collection of Goliardic medieval Latin poems found on ten leaves (ff. 432\u201341) of the Codex Cantabrigiensis (C, MS Gg. 5.35), now in Cambridge University Library.\n\nHistory and content\nThe songs as they survive are copies made shortly before or after the Norman Conquest (1066). They may have been collected by an English scholar while travelling on the continent sometime after the last datable song (1039), and brought back with him to the church of Saint Augustine at Canterbury, where they were copied and where the Codex was long kept. The original manuscript was possibly lost in a fire that struck Saint Augustine's in 1168. The dialect of the few vernacular portions found in some of the songs is in the North Rheno-Franconian dialect of Old High German, suggesting that the Goliard or Goliards who composed them came from the north or middle Rhineland, probably the area between Trier, Cologne, and Xanten. It has been suggested that some of the songs originated in France or Italy. While most of the Cambridge Songs survive only in the Cambridge manuscript, a few are duplicated in a manuscript, W, from Wolfenb\u00fcttel.": {

To vary the program and to surprise his family, Cornell began to alter his films slightly by adding shots, or changing the endings to films with which they were familiar. This led, in time, to his first and most elaborate film collage, Rose Hobart (1936), coincidentally concurrent with his first box, Soap Bubble Set (1936), later sold to the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

  "Utopia Planitia (Greek and Latin: \"Utopia Land Plain\") is a large plain[2] within Utopia, the largest recognized impact basin on Mars[a] and in the Solar System with an estimated diameter of 3,300 km (2,100 mi).[1] It is the Martian region where the Viking 2 lander touched down and began exploring on September 3, 1976, and the Zhurong rover touched down on May 14, 2021, as a part of the Tianwen-1 missionLake Shawnee Amusement Park, abandoned in 1966, occupies a desecrated native burial ground which was the site of the 1783 Mitchell Clay settler farm. Three of the Clay children (Bartley, Tabitha, Ezekial) were killed by a band of natives; Mitchell Clay led a group of settlers in bloody retaliation, killing several natives. In the 1920s, businessman Conley T. Snidow purchased the site of the Clay farm for development as an amusement park. At least six amusement patrons were killed while the park was in operation; a little girl on the circling swing set was hit after a truck backed into the path of the swing, and a boy drowned in the amusement park's swimming pond. The park's structures and rides are still standing, abandoned and in disrepair. Tours are offered in the days leading up to Halloween, in which the site is described as being \"cursed\" or \"haunted\".[2]": {
