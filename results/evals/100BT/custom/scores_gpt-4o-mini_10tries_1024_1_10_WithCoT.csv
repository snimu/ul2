c,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,3.0,8.0,3.0,2.0,"The Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary is the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamilton, New Zealand. It was opened in 1975, replacing an earlier Neo-Classical building known as St Mary's",".
The exterior of The Cathedral has fourteen gold-tinted domes, one for each of the apostles. The roof is covered with serrated glass and two futuristic silver roofs, one of which was the world's largest at the time of construction.
Other architectural features include intricate stained glass windows, an elephant, carved chandeliers, and a hooked cross made of gold leaf. The arched entrance is flanked by two figures representing time. One acts as witness to the journey of human vessel through the passage of time. Across the front of the church is displayed the writings of Mother Mary, a magnifying glass, a light bulb and a glass lantern.
The interior of the church, as with many cathedrals, is fitted with major artwork and exhibits, in this case over 1000 religious pieces. Its centerpiece is Michelangelo's magnificently detailed 17-foot (5.2 m) long Last Judgement fresco. The façade has sculptures of saints, standing guard over the choice for heaven or hell, by Nicola Cavalluti.
The Monstrance, the gift of Sisters of Belmont, was given 2000. It is the larger-than-life crown of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy for use during adoration services held on Chrismtas Eve and on Corpus Christi. It weighs 50 kg. The Crown is actually veiled by a portiere and shielded by medallions of at least four Queens, Mary Magdalene, St Jude, St Mary of Bruges, and St Celestine. The safety of the Crown is secured by on-board cameras and viewing screens. A prayer to be added to the blessing rite of the Monstrance was made by Robert Milton, the bishop of Hamilton. Bishop Milton, along with the other Aviation priests, accepted the donation from FSC Commercial Owners in March 1999.
One of the main altars is The Pierced Heart of Jesus, by renowned artist Domenico Sarnese. It was donated by the governor of New Zealand, Sir Alan Falla. During ""Stations of the Cross"" processions, light falls from its burnished interior and shimmers around the front of the Sanctuary.

c,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,4.0,7.0,6.0,1.0,"The Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary is the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamilton, New Zealand. It was opened in 1975, replacing an earlier Neo-Classical building known as St Mary's",".
The exterior of The Cathedral has fourteen gold-tinted domes, one for each of the apostles. The roof is covered with serrated glass and two futuristic silver roofs, one of which was the world's largest at the time of construction.
Other architectural features include intricate stained glass windows, an elephant, carved chandeliers, and a hooked cross made of gold leaf. The arched entrance is flanked by two figures representing time. One acts as witness to the journey of human vessel through the passage of time. Across the front of the church is displayed the writings of Mother Mary, a magnifying glass, a light bulb and a glass lantern.
The interior of the church, as with many cathedrals, is fitted with major artwork and exhibits, in this case over 1000 religious pieces. Its centerpiece is Michelangelo's magnificently detailed 17-foot (5.2 m) long Last Judgement fresco. The façade has sculptures of saints, standing guard over the choice for heaven or hell, by Nicola Cavalluti.
The Monstrance, the gift of Sisters of Belmont, was given 2000. It is the larger-than-life crown of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy for use during adoration services held on Chrismtas Eve and on Corpus Christi. It weighs 50 kg. The Crown is actually veiled by a portiere and shielded by medallions of at least four Queens, Mary Magdalene, St Jude, St Mary of Bruges, and St Celestine. The safety of the Crown is secured by on-board cameras and viewing screens. A prayer to be added to the blessing rite of the Monstrance was made by Robert Milton, the bishop of Hamilton. Bishop Milton, along with the other Aviation priests, accepted the donation from FSC Commercial Owners in March 1999.
One of the main altars is The Pierced Heart of Jesus, by renowned artist Domenico Sarnese. It was donated by the governor of New Zealand, Sir Alan Falla. During ""Stations of the Cross"" processions, light falls from its burnished interior and shimmers around the front of the Sanctuary.

The current structure, although similar in many ways to the earlier one, incorporates new technologies with its nesting roof design and structural engineering incorporating a 1:4 footprint ratio. It is the only secondary cathedral in New Zealand.
Despite being designed as one, the two buildings actually house three classes of church: diocesan, Roman Catholic, and Anglican.
The buildings house a large congregation and are one of the main sites of Christian activity in Hamilton. Services are conducted during the day, and there is an active school foundation in the building.
At the time it began construction, St Mary's Church was the most advanced structure in the world of its style and, with two gigantically scaled, gothic towers, it was also the largest.
Construction of the Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary was still under way on the starting day of the shoot when after the advent of the Ford Featherwitzer interlocking doors, the city needed to find a new church as the rest of St Mary's was demolished to make way for it.
When the doors were opened the designs of the old building within the interior were covered by a curtain. Once inside the cathedral the horror could be seen, the iron framing stifling the effects of the heavy fan and the elevated central church structure when coupled with the crowd in the entrance, the room was more ravaged.
The pretty exterior was none too welcoming the day it was constructed, ask any Hamilton boy from the time the new dome came up, an elevator was needed to rescue folks from the room where you couldn't get out of. The interior still passible today, so it's fair to say that the two can't be that dissimilar as one can tell when visiting the building today.

The buildings house a large congregation and are one of the main sites of Christian activity in Hamilton. Services are conducted during the day, and there is an active school foundation in the building.
At the time it began construction, St Mary's Church was the most advanced structure in the world of its style and, with two gigantically scaled, gothic towers, it was also the largest.
Construction of the Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary was still under way on the starting day of the shoot when after the advent of the Ford Featherwitzer interlocking doors, the city needed to find a new church as the rest of St Mary's was demolished to make way for it.
When the doors were opened the designs of the old building within the interior were covered by a curtain. Once inside the cathedral the horror could be seen, the iron framing stifling the effects of the heavy fan and the elevated central church structure when coupled with the crowd in the entrance, the room was more ravaged.
The pretty exterior was none too welcoming the day it was constructed, ask any Hamilton boy from the time the new dome came up, an elevator was needed to rescue folks from the room where you couldn't get out of. The interior still passible today, so it's fair to say that the two can't be that dissimilar as one can tell when visiting the building today.

Dunedin City or New Zealand's main peninsula or Dunednong (small town or village) is the world's southernmost city in New Zealand. It is three hours from Christchurch and 600 kilometres from South Pole. Dunedin was the capital of the Otago Province from 1862 to 1871 and the head office of the Otago Provincial Government. It is in the South Island of New Zealand and has a population of 103,400. More than half of Dunedin is one Australians descended from Scottish immigrants or their descendants. The city has many parks, and the natural features of the Oratia Valley are a attraction. In 2004, the famed Dunedin Dunedin Watchtower was declared as one of New Zealand's eight great engineering wonders.
Dunedin is named after the Edinburgh of Scotland. The city's climate has a temperate climate, with warm sub-tropical summers and relatively mild winters. Rainfall occurs as focal precipitation mostly from April to September. The lowest temperature recorded was − 14 °C (8 °F) in January 1982, and the lowest barometric pressure recorded was 940 mbar (−48.0 inHg; 29.59 kPa) in March 1909 in a period when the barometer appeared to have merely broken. The highest recorded temperature was 35.8 °C (96 °F) on 26 February 1975. The average diurnal temperature range is 43 °C. The sub-antarctic trough causes heavy snowfalls in some years. Christchurch in the south is prone to the same factors, Dunedin is sheltered by the ranges of the Southern Alps, and thus avoids these effects to an extent. The event is rare, but is still possible. Fin Esk plays an important role in both.
The city (which includes Oakura) is located in the south-east corner of the Otago Peninsula and the south of the city lies in the basin of the larger Cromwell River and surrounds Otago Harbour. Northwards it runs the Tasman Glacier. The larger city has many other rivers (such as the Heathcote River and the Otago River) and many lakes, most notably Lakes Wakatipu, Tekapo, Howick and Pukaki. The Selkirk Mountains lie to the west, the Southern Alps lie to the east, and the Caledonian Mountains lie to the south of Dunedin. The city's equivalent area is 8 square miles, the jewel and other parts are left with the Kelburn forest to the north-east.
The city's longest running non-stop motor services in service are between Canterbury and Dunedin. The first intercity passenger trains between the two cities began running in 1877, and since this first intercity passenger service, bound for Canterbury Line, from St. Matthew Station, Christchurch have operated non-stop trains to Dunedin every half-hour on Sunday mornings except for a few blocks on Saturday nights. Currently, Anzac Tunnel is the most essential part of this connection from Christchurch to Dunedin and local railways. The inner linking and connecting tunnels are reported to cost  billions in funding costs and this strategy alone needs further support from politicians and citizens. This could increase the pressure to close Hither Crossing, and as-or-Little reduced rail traffic and high operating costs of Southern Railways, if it is not done on immediately. The Rail Tunnel Contract section of the proposal is due to be completed next year this work to be published in 2017.

Dunedin City or New Zealand's main peninsula or Dunednong (small town or village) is the world's southernmost city in New Zealand. It is three hours from Christchurch and 600 kilometres from South Pole. Dunedin was the capital of the Otago Province from 1862 to 1871 and the head office of the Otago Provincial Government. It is in the South Island of New Zealand and has a population of 103,400. More than half of Dunedin is one Australians descended from Scottish immigrants or their descendants. The city has many parks, and the natural features of the Oratia Valley are a attraction. In 2004, the famed Dunedin Dunedin Watchtower was declared as one of New Zealand's eight great engineering wonders.
Dunedin is named after the Edinburgh of Scotland. The city's climate has a temperate climate, with warm sub-tropical summers and relatively mild winters. Rainfall occurs as focal precipitation mostly from April to September. The lowest temperature recorded was − 14 °C (8 °F) in January 1982, and the lowest barometric pressure recorded was 940 mbar (−48.0 inHg; 29.59 kPa) in March 1909 in a period when the barometer appeared to have merely broken. The highest recorded temperature was 35.8 °C (96 °F) on 26 February 1975. The average diurnal temperature range is 43 °C. The sub-antarctic trough causes heavy snowfalls in some years. Christchurch in the south is prone to the same factors, Dunedin is sheltered by the ranges of the Southern Alps, and thus avoids these effects to an extent. The event is rare, but is still possible.

The lowest temperature recorded was − 14 °C (8 °F) in January 1982, and the lowest barometric pressure recorded was 940 mbar (−48.0 inHg; 29.59 kPa) in March 1909 in a period when the barometer appeared to have merely broken. The highest recorded temperature was 35.8 °C (96 °F) on 26 February 1975. The average diurnal temperature range is 43 °C. The sub-antarctic trough causes heavy snowfalls in some years.

The first intercity passenger trains between the two cities began running in 1877, and since this first intercity passenger service, bound for Canterbury Line, from St. Matthew Station, Christchurch have operated non-stop trains to Dunedin every half-hour on Sunday mornings except for a few blocks on Saturday nights. Currently, Anzac Tunnel is the most essential part of this connection from Christchurch to Dunedin and local railways. The inner linking and connecting tunnels are reported to cost  billions in funding costs and this strategy alone needs further support from politicians and citizens. This could increase the pressure to close Hither Crossing, and as-or-Little reduced rail traffic and high operating costs of Southern Railways, if it is not done on immediately.

r,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,3.0,"The Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary is the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamilton, New Zealand. It was opened in 1975, replacing an earlier Neo-Classical building known as St Mary's",".
The exterior of The Cathedral has fourteen gold-tinted domes, one for each of the apostles. The roof is covered with serrated glass and two futuristic silver roofs, one of which was the world's largest at the time of construction.
Other architectural features include intricate stained glass windows, an elephant, carved chandeliers, and a hooked cross made of gold leaf. The arched entrance is flanked by two figures representing time. One acts as witness to the journey of human vessel through the passage of time. Across the front of the church is displayed the writings of Mother Mary, a magnifying glass, a light bulb and a glass lantern.
The interior of the church, as with many cathedrals, is fitted with major artwork and exhibits, in this case over 1000 religious pieces. Its centerpiece is Michelangelo's magnificently detailed 17-foot (5.2 m) long Last Judgement fresco. The façade has sculptures of saints, standing guard over the choice for heaven or hell, by Nicola Cavalluti.
The Monstrance, the gift of Sisters of Belmont, was given 2000. It is the larger-than-life crown of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy for use during adoration services held on Chrismtas Eve and on Corpus Christi. It weighs 50 kg. The Crown is actually veiled by a portiere and shielded by medallions of at least four Queens, Mary Magdalene, St Jude, St Mary of Bruges, and St Celestine. The safety of the Crown is secured by on-board cameras and viewing screens. A prayer to be added to the blessing rite of the Monstrance was made by Robert Milton, the bishop of Hamilton. Bishop Milton, along with the other Aviation priests, accepted the donation from FSC Commercial Owners in March 1999.
One of the main altars is The Pierced Heart of Jesus, by renowned artist Domenico Sarnese. It was donated by the governor of New Zealand, Sir Alan Falla. During ""Stations of the Cross"" processions, light falls from its burnished interior and shimmers around the front of the Sanctuary.

It is the larger-than-life crown of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy for use during adoration services held on Chrismtas Eve and on Corpus Christi. It weighs 50 kg. The Crown is actually veiled by a portiere and shielded by medallions of at least four Queens, Mary Magdalene, St Jude, St Mary of Bruges, and St Celestine. The safety of the Crown is secured by on-board cameras and viewing screens. A prayer to be added to the blessing rite of the Monstrance was made by Robert Milton, the bishop of Hamilton. Bishop Milton, along with the other Aviation priests, accepted the donation from FSC Commercial Owners in March 1999.
One of the main altars is The Pierced Heart of Jesus, by renowned artist Domenico Sarnese. It was donated by the governor of New Zealand, Sir Alan Falla. During ""Stations of the Cross"" processions, light falls from its burnished interior and shimmers around the front of the Sanctuary.

The exterior of The Cathedral has fourteen gold-tinted domes, one for each of the apostles. The roof is covered with serrated glass and two futuristic silver roofs, one of which was the world's largest at the time of construction.
Other architectural features include intricate stained glass windows, an elephant, carved chandeliers, and a hooked cross made of gold leaf. The arched entrance is flanked by two figures representing time. One acts as witness to the journey of human vessel through the passage of time. Across the front of the church is displayed the writings of Mother Mary, a magnifying glass, a light bulb and a glass lantern.
The interior of the church, as with many cathedrals, is fitted with major artwork and exhibits, in this case over 1000 religious pieces. Its centerpiece is Michelangelo's magnificently detailed 17-foot (5.2 m) long Last Judgement fresco. The façade has sculptures of saints, standing guard over the choice for heaven or hell, by Nicola Cavalluti.

Nature has been unfixed; it has properties of discrete variables distributed according to the logic of probabilities, and we talk of chance events.

But God remains, operating unpredictably.

Nature has been unfixed; it has properties of discrete variables distributed according to the logic of probabilities, and we talk of chance events. As interpretations of chance, however, they are incomplete and unflattering: long trains of tales of chance births and coincidences have been lodged; chance is generally accepted as a way of eliminating God. But God remains, operating unpredictably.

Christians pay a special tax when property is passed on to another Christian in direct inheritance; he has not paid tax on the property issue. A spendthrift cousin inherits from his general term's cousin, but it is his responsibility to cover his tax obligation through payments to council.

In the year 1863 dissensions arose amongst the Church of England people in greater Victoria, in connection with choice of bishop. Since that time there have been 23 Episcopalians of different classes (mainly Presbyterian) and various Roman Catholic members of the congregation.
The Cathedral Church of Christ the Blessed Virgin Mary is a medieval building, although parts were built using earlier styles. It was built between 1290 and c.1340, with additions and rebuilding in the 14th, 15th and 17th centuries. It contains the Tithe Barn (originally a granary), dating from the 14th century, which is now used for stores.
A west tower was added in 1250 by John of Cambridge, Bishop of Exeter, and it suffered damage in 1874 in an earthquake. The whole of St Nicholas Chapel (1466), with its gabled roof and the exterior gun-loops, was built in a severe Decorated Gothic style. Besides the remains of the old bishop's palace and the close Recusant buildings dating from before the Reformation, a fine early self‐portrait of Christopher Wren is displayed in Wren's Gallery.
The church has original interior features such as an original parish chest, a most valuable set of monuments with statues and heraldry and various octagonal fonts.

In 1837, Colonel Henry Fowler and John Dunedin represented the two Otago Company founders, James Horsburgh and John Logan Campbell when the colonial government (which had purchased the South Island from the Maoris by purchase) passed the Otago Bill which created the Southland and Otago districts. At the next Governor's Council meeting, Bishop David's plan was adopted by Parliament for the formation of a new bishopric (i.e., a bishop for each of the four dioceses in New Zealand); attached to Bishop David was a list of 15 clergymen whom he considered to be 'suitable candidates for ordination to the ministry in the two fledgling dioceses of Waitakere and Otago'.
Bishop David was the first to preside over a diocese in New Zealand. In October 1839 he requested the bishopric of the Otago diocese from New Zealand's Legislative Council and the Privy Council.

In the year 1863 dissensions arose amongst the Church of England people in greater Victoria, in connection with choice of bishop. Since that time there have been 23 Episcopalians of different classes (mainly Presbyterian) and various Roman Catholic members of the congregation.
The Cathedral Church of Christ the Blessed Virgin Mary is a medieval building, although parts were built using earlier styles. It was built between 1290 and c.1340, with additions and rebuilding in the 14th, 15th and 17th centuries. It contains the Tithe Barn (originally a granary), dating from the 14th century, which is now used for stores.
A west tower was added in 1250 by John of Cambridge, Bishop of Exeter, and it suffered damage in 1874 in an earthquake. The whole of St Nicholas Chapel (1466), with its gabled roof and the exterior gun-loops, was built in a severe Decorated Gothic style. Besides the remains of the old bishop's palace and the close Recusant buildings dating from before the Reformation, a fine early self‐portrait of Christopher Wren is displayed in Wren's Gallery.
The church has original interior features such as an original parish chest, a most valuable set of monuments with statues and heraldry and various octagonal fonts.

It was opened in 1975, replacing an earlier Neo-Classical building known as St Mary's"," Cathedral, Hamilton which had been completed in 1877. The church's Latin cross style has a height of 95 metres (311 ft) above mean sea level; the tallest church in the World New Zealand.
The cathedral is the main place of worship for the Roman Catholic diocese since its foundation in 1891. The city of Hamilton is the see of a Roman Catholic bishop, Michael Edward J. Luther. The architect of the cathedral was Sir Warren Dixon. The cathedral cost a reported $25 million (Australian dollars), and was consecrated on 8 May 1975 by Archbishop Kenney of Sydney, in the presence of the Prime Minister of Australia, John Gorton.
The cathedral in Hamilton is a parish church, to which a minor basilica status was granted in 1986; the chief elements of the basilica include, the five-tiered staircase, the grand arch separating the nave and chancel from the transepts, and the confessionals.
The first Cathedral in the Diocese of Hamilton was built between 1870 and 1877 at a cost of $12,000 (Canadian) and was worn out by the early 1960s. It was replaced by a new cathedral in 1960. It quickly outgrew the building. The education and arts programmes grew more demanding. The Cathedral required a modern front, which the Archbishop directed his architect, Sir Warren Dixon, to create. Design work was certainly completed by 1968. However the festival of the anniversary of the building of the new cathedral (1971) had to be extended to a week in length.Havelock School hosted the Caedmon Festival: Pupils from the Havelock High School choir, and from the St Thomas' Cathedral choir went on tour.
A story in the Hamilton Spectator points to mix-ups in fundraising activities. It states that many local companies and schools raised funds to assist with building the Cathedral. However, from one source they were all denied, and told that their money should have been directed to other sources.
On 5 September 1972, an inaugural service was held on site for two priests including the Bishop of Auckland, Francis Eade. The service was conducted by a VV(S)'zone' - that is a vast space with large congregation occupying all the excesses, with only limited movement. The service consisted of 9 pre-services including Caritas, Tropism and Solemn Pontifical Requiem Mass.
The tower was opened to the public on 3 February 1974 with ten permanent exhibits. On Saturday 23 March, after forty years of planning by the Medieval Guild of Hamilton, the tower was dedicated. The price for admission was one shilling (12.5¢ Canadian, or 33¾p English).
At the base of the tower are three ancient Norman windows:
- A window in the west wall at the first and second levels contains faded medieval paintings of a church, perhaps the church identified by descendants of the Anselm, in 1016.
- A much wider one in the east window may represent the original Norman church of 1048 and 1236 stories underneath.
- A small glazed arched window at the base of the tower in x- process that was operated by a pulley. This was probably installed in 1740. This window looks out towards theUniversity of Otago.
- The rose windows designed by the architect spent twelve days constructing each circular window. The architect even renovated the Cathedral during construction.
There are 15 stained glass windows each measuring about 8.5 feet (2.6 m) wide and 15 feet (4.6 m) tall. Space allows 22 images of saints and high façade includes:
- their statues or their standard emblems:
- Saints of Irish origin in the front of the church
- stained glass Cathedral ceiling designed by Austin Cooper between 1964 and 1967
There are three separate chapels. The larger, innermost chapel is known as the Eden Chapel –in recognition of earlier religious beliefs. The Eden Chapel is a buried ruin dating possibly back to the 16th century and two stained glass windows were created by A.C. Symonds which depict angels and stories in the bible. The very top church is a sealed pew accessed by man in a belltower or formerly via a lift. The interior and mixed octagonal and circular space were designed by A.J.

The tower was opened to the public on 3 February 1974 with ten permanent exhibits. On Saturday 23 March, after forty years of planning by the Medieval Guild of Hamilton, the tower was dedicated. The price for admission was one shilling (12.5¢ Canadian, or 33¾p English).
At the base of the tower are three ancient Norman windows:
- A window in the west wall at the first and second levels contains faded medieval paintings of a church, perhaps the church identified by descendants of the Anselm, in 1016.
- A much wider one in the east window may represent the original Norman church of 1048 and 1236 stories underneath.
- A small glazed arched window at the base of the tower in x- process that was operated by a pulley. This was probably installed in 1740. This window looks out towards theUniversity of Otago.
- The rose windows designed by the architect spent twelve days constructing each circular window. The architect even renovated the Cathedral during construction.
There are 15 stained glass windows each measuring about 8.5 feet (2.6 m) wide and 15 feet (4.6 m) tall. Space allows 22 images of saints and high façade includes:
- their statues or their standard emblems:
- Saints of Irish origin in the front of the church
- stained glass Cathedral ceiling designed by Austin Cooper between 1964 and 1967
There are three separate chapels. The larger, innermost chapel is known as the Eden Chapel –in recognition of earlier religious beliefs. The Eden Chapel is a buried ruin dating possibly back to the 16th century and two stained glass windows were created by A.C. Symonds which depict angels and stories in the bible. The very top church is a sealed pew accessed by man in a belltower or formerly via a lift. The interior and mixed octagonal and circular space were designed by A.J. Rogunand is clearly visible from the river and eyesight is accessible at church entrances and other vantage points.

The church's Latin cross style has a height of 95 metres (311 ft) above mean sea level; the tallest church in the World New Zealand.
The cathedral is the main place of worship for the Roman Catholic diocese since its foundation in 1891. The city of Hamilton is the see of a Roman Catholic bishop, Michael Edward J. Luther.

The cathedral in Hamilton is a parish church, to which a minor basilica status was granted in 1986; the chief elements of the basilica include, the five-tiered staircase, the grand arch separating the nave and chancel from the transepts, and the confessionals.
The first Cathedral in the Diocese of Hamilton was built between 1870 and 1877 at a cost of $12,000 (Canadian) and was worn out by the early 1960s. It was replaced by a new cathedral in 1960. It quickly outgrew the building. The education and arts programmes grew more demanding. The Cathedral required a modern front, which the Archbishop directed his architect, Sir Warren Dixon, to create. Design work was certainly completed by 1968.

A story in the Hamilton Spectator points to mix-ups in fundraising activities. It states that many local companies and schools raised funds to assist with building the Cathedral. However, from one source they were all denied, and told that their money should have been directed to other sources.

Dunedin City or New Zealand's main peninsula or Dunednong (small town or village) is the world's southernmost city in New Zealand. It is three hours from Christchurch and 600 kilometres from South Pole. Dunedin was the capital of the Otago Province from 1862 to 1871 and the head office of the Otago Provincial Government. It is in the South Island of New Zealand and has a population of 103,400. More than half of Dunedin is one Australians descended from Scottish immigrants or their descendants. The city has many parks, and the natural features of the Oratia Valley are a attraction. In 2004, the famed Dunedin Dunedin Watchtower was declared as one of New Zealand's eight great engineering wonders.
Dunedin is named after the Edinburgh of Scotland. The city's climate has a temperate climate, with warm sub-tropical summers and relatively mild winters. Rainfall occurs as focal precipitation mostly from April to September. The lowest temperature recorded was − 14 °C (8 °F) in January 1982, and the lowest barometric pressure recorded was 940 mbar (−48.0 inHg; 29.59 kPa) in March 1909 in a period when the barometer appeared to have merely broken. The highest recorded temperature was 35.8 °C (96 °F) on 26 February 1975. The average diurnal temperature range is 43 °C. The sub-antarctic trough causes heavy snowfalls in some years. Christchurch in the south is prone to the same factors, Dunedin is sheltered by the ranges of the Southern Alps, and thus avoids these effects to an extent. The event is rare, but is still possible. Fin Esk plays an important role in both.
The city (which includes Oakura) is located in the south-east corner of the Otago Peninsula and the south of the city lies in the basin of the larger Cromwell River and surrounds Otago Harbour. Northwards it runs the Tasman Glacier. The larger city has many other rivers (such as the Heathcote River and the Otago River) and many lakes, most notably Lakes Wakatipu, Tekapo, Howick and Pukaki. The Selkirk Mountains lie to the west, the Southern Alps lie to the east, and the Caledonian Mountains lie to the south of Dunedin. The city's equivalent area is 8 square miles, the jewel and other parts are left with the Kelburn forest to the north-east.
The city's longest running non-stop motor services in service are between Canterbury and Dunedin. The first intercity passenger trains between the two cities began running in 1877, and since this first intercity passenger service, bound for Canterbury Line, from St. Matthew Station, Christchurch have operated non-stop trains to Dunedin every half-hour on Sunday mornings except for a few blocks on Saturday nights. Currently, Anzac Tunnel is the most essential part of this connection from Christchurch to Dunedin and local railways. The inner linking and connecting tunnels are reported to cost  billions in funding costs and this strategy alone needs further support from politicians and citizens. This could increase the pressure to close Hither Crossing, and as-or-Little reduced rail traffic and high operating costs of Southern Railways, if it is not done on immediately. The Rail Tunnel Contract section of the proposal is due to be completed next year this work to be published in 2017.

In 2004, the famed Dunedin Dunedin Watchtower was declared as one of New Zealand's eight great engineering wonders.
Dunedin is named after the Edinburgh of Scotland. The city's climate has a temperate climate, with warm sub-tropical summers and relatively mild winters. Rainfall occurs as focal precipitation mostly from April to September. The lowest temperature recorded was − 14 °C (8 °F) in January 1982, and the lowest barometric pressure recorded was 940 mbar (−48.0 inHg; 29.59 kPa) in March 1909 in a period when the barometer appeared to have merely broken. The highest recorded temperature was 35.8 °C (96 °F) on 26 February 1975. The average diurnal temperature range is 43 °C. The sub-antarctic trough causes heavy snowfalls in some years. Christchurch in the south is prone to the same factors, Dunedin is sheltered by the ranges of the Southern Alps, and thus avoids these effects to an extent. The event is rare, but is still possible. Fin Esk plays an important role in both.
The city (which includes Oakura) is located in the south-east corner of the Otago Peninsula and the south of the city lies in the basin of the larger Cromwell River and surrounds Otago Harbour. Northwards it runs the Tasman Glacier. The larger city has many other rivers (such as the Heathcote River and the Otago River) and many lakes, most notably Lakes Wakatipu, Tekapo, Howick and Pukaki. The Selkirk Mountains lie to the west, the Southern Alps lie to the east, and the Caledonian Mountains lie to the south of Dunedin. The city's equivalent area is 8 square miles, the jewel and other parts are left with the Kelburn forest to the north-east.
The city's longest running non-stop motor services in service are between Canterbury and Dunedin. The first intercity passenger trains between the two cities began running in 1877, and since this first intercity passenger service, bound for Canterbury Line, from St. Matthew Station, Christchurch have operated non-stop trains to Dunedin every half-hour on Sunday mornings except for a few blocks on Saturday nights.

At the next Governor's Council meeting, Bishop David's plan was adopted by Parliament for the formation of a new bishopric (i.e., a bishop for each of the four dioceses in New Zealand); attached to Bishop David was a list of 15 clergymen whom he considered to be 'suitable candidates for ordination to the ministry in the two fledgling dioceses of Waitakere and Otago'.
Bishop David was the first to preside over a diocese in New Zealand. In October 1839 he requested the bishopric of the Otago diocese from New Zealand's Legislative Council and the Privy Council.

The Cathedral Church of Christ the Blessed Virgin Mary is a medieval building, although parts were built using earlier styles. It was built between 1290 and c.1340, with additions and rebuilding in the 14th, 15th and 17th centuries. It contains the Tithe Barn (originally a granary), dating from the 14th century, which is now used for stores.
A west tower was added in 1250 by John of Cambridge, Bishop of Exeter, and it suffered damage in 1874 in an earthquake. The whole of St Nicholas Chapel (1466), with its gabled roof and the exterior gun-loops, was built in a severe Decorated Gothic style. Besides the remains of the old bishop's palace and the close Recusant buildings dating from before the Reformation, a fine early self‐portrait of Christopher Wren is displayed in Wren's Gallery.
The church has original interior features such as an original parish chest, a most valuable set of monuments with statues and heraldry and various octagonal fonts.

In 1837, Colonel Henry Fowler and John Dunedin represented the two Otago Company founders, James Horsburgh and John Logan Campbell when the colonial government (which had purchased the South Island from the Maoris by purchase) passed the Otago Bill which created the Southland and Otago districts. At the next Governor's Council meeting, Bishop David's plan was adopted by Parliament for the formation of a new bishopric (i.e., a bishop for each of the four dioceses in New Zealand); attached to Bishop David was a list of 15 clergymen whom he considered to be 'suitable candidates for ordination to the ministry in the two fledgling dioceses of Waitakere and Otago'.
Bishop David was the first to preside over a diocese in New Zealand. In October 1839 he requested the bishopric of the Otago diocese from New Zealand's Legislative Council and the Privy Council.

In the year 1863 dissensions arose amongst the Church of England people in greater Victoria, in connection with choice of bishop. Since that time there have been 23 Episcopalians of different classes (mainly Presbyterian) and various Roman Catholic members of the congregation.
The Cathedral Church of Christ the Blessed Virgin Mary is a medieval building, although parts were built using earlier styles. It was built between 1290 and c.1340, with additions and rebuilding in the 14th, 15th and 17th centuries. It contains the Tithe Barn (originally a granary), dating from the 14th century, which is now used for stores.
A west tower was added in 1250 by John of Cambridge, Bishop of Exeter, and it suffered damage in 1874 in an earthquake. The whole of St Nicholas Chapel (1466), with its gabled roof and the exterior gun-loops, was built in a severe Decorated Gothic style. Besides the remains of the old bishop's palace and the close Recusant buildings dating from before the Reformation, a fine early self‐portrait of Christopher Wren is displayed in Wren's Gallery.
The church has original interior features such as an original parish chest, a most valuable set of monuments with statues and heraldry and various octagonal fonts.

r,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,2.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,"The Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary is the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamilton, New Zealand. It was opened in 1975, replacing an earlier Neo-Classical building known as St Mary's"," built in 1827-1829. The current structure, although similar in many ways to the earlier one, incorporates new technologies with its nesting roof design and structural engineering incorporating a 1:4 footprint ratio. It is the only secondary cathedral in New Zealand.
Despite being designed as one, the two buildings actually house three classes of church: diocesan, Roman Catholic, and Anglican.
The buildings house a large congregation and are one of the main sites of Christian activity in Hamilton. Services are conducted during the day, and there is an active school foundation in the building.
At the time it began construction, St Mary's Church was the most advanced structure in the world of its style and, with two gigantically scaled, gothic towers, it was also the largest.
Construction of the Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary was still under way on the starting day of the shoot when after the advent of the Ford Featherwitzer interlocking doors, the city needed to find a new church as the rest of St Mary's was demolished to make way for it.
When the doors were opened the designs of the old building within the interior were covered by a curtain. Once inside the cathedral the horror could be seen, the iron framing stifling the effects of the heavy fan and the elevated central church structure when coupled with the crowd in the entrance, the room was more ravaged.
The pretty exterior was none too welcoming the day it was constructed, ask any Hamilton boy from the time the new dome came up, an elevator was needed to rescue folks from the room where you couldn't get out of. The interior still passible today, so it's fair to say that the two can't be that dissimilar as one can tell when visiting the building today.
The two guests that have travelled to the BBC Tech Flight within Hamilton are due to land on the Holmes Bay pier when they land the documentary was originally mentioned on the web site. Not the first time so far but it is the first film in the History Channel ExecChamp's Man alone: The True Story of the Kitchen Sink Boys.
Traditionally a 1936 production by David Ramsey and Sun Charman's, it has produced hundreds more just recently with the same characters due to appear in a second film spotlight 2011: The Future of Home Enterprise.
Many of the on-set productions have been shown including Tales of Wonder and The Making of Me, the latter using locations from Sea World and the PDX fairgrounds and Vancouver Canada.
The International Noah's Ark Dinner was held at Market Square. Pizza, chicken, chicken salad and release of animated artwork in front of the new caisson on loan to the Canton Restoration Project after a successful Auto Festival Expo Day's launch.
The Carpenters arrived and welcomed fans to the new visitors building where the Veles brothers surprised everyone by opening up the front door! News was quickly spread across to Team Carpenters which was towed to the river to await launch as an impending flood swept the city in a mass geyser of water.
A car from the old car that's chocked with bugs that was caught in a pipe by being filled with skateboards and busted up by a big structure raced around the oval before being kicked into the River God while it was loyal to the Babo Hours of Darkness and the Elohi Opto Sailing Team.
The females stayed in the survival course in the ark and the males spaced themselves out over the arch and flew around to greet the birds coming down. The birds watched them for a while while doing their own presentation.
All around the perimeter of the building the ground shook from the earth rising upwards. The boat under the pavement came up at 5m exploding it's auto take place and pieces of the building came flying many meters away.
Demosthenes played optimistically of the 'flood' of music coming down for the festival prompting all music's to turn up loudly. Astonisheding sprays whipped the crowd and the atmosphere was set to recreate an idea of ancient times.
A new theme tune to be taken from Willis' homesoundtunes logo was seen in the DJ booth commanding everyone to raise their arms in a song connecting to the points on the logo.

It was opened in 1975, replacing an earlier Neo-Classical building known as St Mary's"," built in 1827-1829. The current structure, although similar in many ways to the earlier one, incorporates new technologies with its nesting roof design and structural engineering incorporating a 1:4 footprint ratio. It is the only secondary cathedral in New Zealand.
Despite being designed as one, the two buildings actually house three classes of church: diocesan, Roman Catholic, and Anglican.
The buildings house a large congregation and are one of the main sites of Christian activity in Hamilton. Services are conducted during the day, and there is an active school foundation in the building.
At the time it began construction, St Mary's Church was the most advanced structure in the world of its style and, with two gigantically scaled, gothic towers, it was also the largest.
Construction of the Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary was still under way on the starting day of the shoot when after the advent of the Ford Featherwitzer interlocking doors, the city needed to find a new church as the rest of St Mary's was demolished to make way for it.
When the doors were opened the designs of the old building within the interior were covered by a curtain. Once inside the cathedral the horror could be seen, the iron framing stifling the effects of the heavy fan and the elevated central church structure when coupled with the crowd in the entrance, the room was more ravaged.
The pretty exterior was none too welcoming the day it was constructed, ask any Hamilton boy from the time the new dome came up, an elevator was needed to rescue folks from the room where you couldn't get out of. The interior still passible today, so it's fair to say that the two can't be that dissimilar as one can tell when visiting the building today.
The two guests that have travelled to the BBC Tech Flight within Hamilton are due to land on the Holmes Bay pier when they land the documentary was originally mentioned on the web site. Not the first time so far but it is the first film in the History Channel ExecChamp's Man alone: The True Story of the Kitchen Sink Boys.
Traditionally a 1936 production by David Ramsey and Sun Charman's, it has produced hundreds more just recently with the same characters due to appear in a second film spotlight 2011: The Future of Home Enterprise.
Many of the on-set productions have been shown including Tales of Wonder and The Making of Me, the latter using locations from Sea World and the PDX fairgrounds and Vancouver Canada.
The International Noah's Ark Dinner was held at Market Square. Pizza, chicken, chicken salad and release of animated artwork in front of the new caisson on loan to the Canton Restoration Project after a successful Auto Festival Expo Day's launch.
The Carpenters arrived and welcomed fans to the new visitors building where the Veles brothers surprised everyone by opening up the front door! News was quickly spread across to Team Carpenters which was towed to the river to await launch as an impending flood swept the city in a mass geyser of water.
A car from the old car that's chocked with bugs that was caught in a pipe by being filled with skateboards and busted up by a big structure raced around the oval before being kicked into the River God while it was loyal to the Babo Hours of Darkness and the Elohi Opto Sailing Team.
The females stayed in the survival course in the ark and the males spaced themselves out over the arch and flew around to greet the birds coming down. The birds watched them for a while while doing their own presentation.
All around the perimeter of the building the ground shook from the earth rising upwards. The boat under the pavement came up at 5m exploding it's auto take place and pieces of the building came flying many meters away.
Demosthenes played optimistically of the 'flood' of music coming down for the festival prompting all music's to turn up loudly. Astonisheding sprays whipped the crowd and the atmosphere was set to recreate an idea of ancient times.

It was opened in 1975, replacing an earlier Neo-Classical building known as St Mary's"," built in 1827-1829. The current structure, although similar in many ways to the earlier one, incorporates new technologies with its nesting roof design and structural engineering incorporating a 1:4 footprint ratio. It is the only secondary cathedral in New Zealand.
Despite being designed as one, the two buildings actually house three classes of church: diocesan, Roman Catholic, and Anglican.
The buildings house a large congregation and are one of the main sites of Christian activity in Hamilton. Services are conducted during the day, and there is an active school foundation in the building.
At the time it began construction, St Mary's Church was the most advanced structure in the world of its style and, with two gigantically scaled, gothic towers, it was also the largest.
Construction of the Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary was still under way on the starting day of the shoot when after the advent of the Ford Featherwitzer interlocking doors, the city needed to find a new church as the rest of St Mary's was demolished to make way for it.
When the doors were opened the designs of the old building within the interior were covered by a curtain. Once inside the cathedral the horror could be seen, the iron framing stifling the effects of the heavy fan and the elevated central church structure when coupled with the crowd in the entrance, the room was more ravaged.
The pretty exterior was none too welcoming the day it was constructed, ask any Hamilton boy from the time the new dome came up, an elevator was needed to rescue folks from the room where you couldn't get out of. The interior still passible today, so it's fair to say that the two can't be that dissimilar as one can tell when visiting the building today.

c,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,5.0,"The Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary is the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamilton, New Zealand. It was opened in 1975, replacing an earlier Neo-Classical building known as St Mary's"," Cathedral, Hamilton which had been completed in 1877. The church's Latin cross style has a height of 95 metres (311 ft) above mean sea level; the tallest church in the World New Zealand.
The cathedral is the main place of worship for the Roman Catholic diocese since its foundation in 1891. The city of Hamilton is the see of a Roman Catholic bishop, Michael Edward J. Luther. The architect of the cathedral was Sir Warren Dixon. The cathedral cost a reported $25 million (Australian dollars), and was consecrated on 8 May 1975 by Archbishop Kenney of Sydney, in the presence of the Prime Minister of Australia, John Gorton.
The cathedral in Hamilton is a parish church, to which a minor basilica status was granted in 1986; the chief elements of the basilica include, the five-tiered staircase, the grand arch separating the nave and chancel from the transepts, and the confessionals.
The first Cathedral in the Diocese of Hamilton was built between 1870 and 1877 at a cost of $12,000 (Canadian) and was worn out by the early 1960s. It was replaced by a new cathedral in 1960. It quickly outgrew the building. The education and arts programmes grew more demanding. The Cathedral required a modern front, which the Archbishop directed his architect, Sir Warren Dixon, to create. Design work was certainly completed by 1968. However the festival of the anniversary of the building of the new cathedral (1971) had to be extended to a week in length.Havelock School hosted the Caedmon Festival: Pupils from the Havelock High School choir, and from the St Thomas' Cathedral choir went on tour.
A story in the Hamilton Spectator points to mix-ups in fundraising activities. It states that many local companies and schools raised funds to assist with building the Cathedral. However, from one source they were all denied, and told that their money should have been directed to other sources.
On 5 September 1972, an inaugural service was held on site for two priests including the Bishop of Auckland, Francis Eade. The service was conducted by a VV(S)'zone' - that is a vast space with large congregation occupying all the excesses, with only limited movement. The service consisted of 9 pre-services including Caritas, Tropism and Solemn Pontifical Requiem Mass.
The tower was opened to the public on 3 February 1974 with ten permanent exhibits. On Saturday 23 March, after forty years of planning by the Medieval Guild of Hamilton, the tower was dedicated. The price for admission was one shilling (12.5¢ Canadian, or 33¾p English).
At the base of the tower are three ancient Norman windows:
- A window in the west wall at the first and second levels contains faded medieval paintings of a church, perhaps the church identified by descendants of the Anselm, in 1016.
- A much wider one in the east window may represent the original Norman church of 1048 and 1236 stories underneath.
- A small glazed arched window at the base of the tower in x- process that was operated by a pulley. This was probably installed in 1740. This window looks out towards theUniversity of Otago.
- The rose windows designed by the architect spent twelve days constructing each circular window. The architect even renovated the Cathedral during construction.
There are 15 stained glass windows each measuring about 8.5 feet (2.6 m) wide and 15 feet (4.6 m) tall. Space allows 22 images of saints and high façade includes:
- their statues or their standard emblems:
- Saints of Irish origin in the front of the church
- stained glass Cathedral ceiling designed by Austin Cooper between 1964 and 1967
There are three separate chapels. The larger, innermost chapel is known as the Eden Chapel –in recognition of earlier religious beliefs. The Eden Chapel is a buried ruin dating possibly back to the 16th century and two stained glass windows were created by A.C. Symonds which depict angels and stories in the bible. The very top church is a sealed pew accessed by man in a belltower or formerly via a lift. The interior and mixed octagonal and circular space were designed by A.J. Rogunand is clearly visible from the river and eyesight is accessible at church entrances and other vantage points.
After Hamiltonwear No 1 Church in the city of Hamilton and St Paul's cathedral in the suburb of Whitireia The Cathedral in Hamilton is considered one of the most beautiful churches in the city.
In addition to the rich architecture, the tree in the centre of the cathedral grounds is also an architectural feat. It was said to be planted by Dame Ronnie Gower, and she planted 20 New Zealand trees, measured between 75 and 90 years old. This tree was one of the last trees planted in Hamilton.

The Eden Chapel is a buried ruin dating possibly back to the 16th century and two stained glass windows were created by A.C. Symonds which depict angels and stories in the bible. The very top church is a sealed pew accessed by man in a belltower or formerly via a lift. The interior and mixed octagonal and circular space were designed by A.J.

After Hamiltonwear No 1 Church in the city of Hamilton and St Paul's cathedral in the suburb of Whitireia The Cathedral in Hamilton is considered one of the most beautiful churches in the city.
In addition to the rich architecture, the tree in the centre of the cathedral grounds is also an architectural feat. It was said to be planted by Dame Ronnie Gower, and she planted 20 New Zealand trees, measured between 75 and 90 years old. This tree was one of the last trees planted in Hamilton.

It was opened in 1975, replacing an earlier Neo-Classical building known as St Mary's"," Cathedral, Hamilton which had been completed in 1877. The church's Latin cross style has a height of 95 metres (311 ft) above mean sea level; the tallest church in the World New Zealand.
The cathedral is the main place of worship for the Roman Catholic diocese since its foundation in 1891. The city of Hamilton is the see of a Roman Catholic bishop, Michael Edward J. Luther. The architect of the cathedral was Sir Warren Dixon. The cathedral cost a reported $25 million (Australian dollars), and was consecrated on 8 May 1975 by Archbishop Kenney of Sydney, in the presence of the Prime Minister of Australia, John Gorton.
The cathedral in Hamilton is a parish church, to which a minor basilica status was granted in 1986; the chief elements of the basilica include, the five-tiered staircase, the grand arch separating the nave and chancel from the transepts, and the confessionals.
The first Cathedral in the Diocese of Hamilton was built between 1870 and 1877 at a cost of $12,000 (Canadian) and was worn out by the early 1960s. It was replaced by a new cathedral in 1960. It quickly outgrew the building. The education and arts programmes grew more demanding. The Cathedral required a modern front, which the Archbishop directed his architect, Sir Warren Dixon, to create. Design work was certainly completed by 1968. However the festival of the anniversary of the building of the new cathedral (1971) had to be extended to a week in length.Havelock School hosted the Caedmon Festival: Pupils from the Havelock High School choir, and from the St Thomas' Cathedral choir went on tour.
A story in the Hamilton Spectator points to mix-ups in fundraising activities. It states that many local companies and schools raised funds to assist with building the Cathedral. However, from one source they were all denied, and told that their money should have been directed to other sources.
On 5 September 1972, an inaugural service was held on site for two priests including the Bishop of Auckland, Francis Eade. The service was conducted by a VV(S)'zone' - that is a vast space with large congregation occupying all the excesses, with only limited movement. The service consisted of 9 pre-services including Caritas, Tropism and Solemn Pontifical Requiem Mass.
The tower was opened to the public on 3 February 1974 with ten permanent exhibits. On Saturday 23 March, after forty years of planning by the Medieval Guild of Hamilton, the tower was dedicated. The price for admission was one shilling (12.5¢ Canadian, or 33¾p English).
At the base of the tower are three ancient Norman windows:
- A window in the west wall at the first and second levels contains faded medieval paintings of a church, perhaps the church identified by descendants of the Anselm, in 1016.
- A much wider one in the east window may represent the original Norman church of 1048 and 1236 stories underneath.
- A small glazed arched window at the base of the tower in x- process that was operated by a pulley. This was probably installed in 1740. This window looks out towards theUniversity of Otago.
- The rose windows designed by the architect spent twelve days constructing each circular window. The architect even renovated the Cathedral during construction.
There are 15 stained glass windows each measuring about 8.5 feet (2.6 m) wide and 15 feet (4.6 m) tall. Space allows 22 images of saints and high façade includes:
- their statues or their standard emblems:
- Saints of Irish origin in the front of the church

The name 'Taka Quinn' 'the place you arrive at' and the name itself invites exploration and understanding. Standing at the confluence of a river and its mouth, the tiny settlement through the passing centuries has served different cultures and markets.

Hamilton ( Punui Maori - Whareroonta) was one of the original ancient places or pouaka as they were called, and the area is of special significance. The name 'Taka Quinn' 'the place you arrive at' and the name itself invites exploration and understanding. Standing at the confluence of a river and its mouth, the tiny settlement through the passing centuries has served different cultures and markets.

I have had the opportunity to visit this city multiple times and each visit generates new experiences. Walking on the bridge, being part of the Georgian era ""Patio stardusters"" I met every weekend, watching the Artisan orchestra supporting the planting of trees from around the world for the Hamilton Artisan.
