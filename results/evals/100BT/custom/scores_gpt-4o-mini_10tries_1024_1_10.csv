c,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,4.0,8.0,3.0,2.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," They are found in grazing upland savanna. The species and its subspecies were formerly regarded as one species, ""rock firefinch"" and ""sangoli harlequin.""
In the past, the rock firefinch was considered a subspecies of the common firefinch, but the rock firefinch was then split into three species (golden firefinch, common firefinch, and rock firefinch) when its mutations were sorted into three reproductive groups by Charles Clusius: common, rock, and savanna; however, this decision has been reversed based on newly collected data and genetic evidence.
The rock firefinch is 22 cm long. The rock firefinch is a black and white bird with a yellow spot on the side of the bird's neck. The bird has black stripes under and above its eyes. The rock firefinch has a beak that is red and white. It is found in Trinidad and Tobago, the canary islands, and the northern coast of Venezuela such as Barlovento and Cristalino.
The rock firefinch is mainly found in cliffs, gorges and cliffs, shaded areas with tall shrubs that grows in Acacia tortillis vegetation. When breeding season arrives, they build their nests in Acacia tortillis. They use ""clean bowl shaped"" nests that is facilitates their illumination by sun rays.
The female rock firefinch binge feed meal to their babies before they have their first fledgling. The parents chirp to tell the babies when it is time to eat again. The rock firefinch nests in a structure such as a ""squat ledge"" to help protect the babies.
The rock firefinch lays two to five eggs. The parents care for the babies in the nests.
The diet of the rock firefinch consists of grass fragments, small insects, and flower heads.
The rock firefinch eats grass, seeds, and some insects. Females turn the young sun rays in the rocky habitat or on the trees.
The rock firefinch has 4 subspecies:
- L. s. stygius
- L. s. linnaei
- L. s. bimaculatus
- L. s. lamasi
- L. s. bimaculatus has the most common habitat
- L. s. bimaculatus was not combined with Linnaeus firefinch in 1811
- L. s. lambasi

c,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,5.0,8.0,3.0,2.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," They are found in grazing upland savanna. The species and its subspecies were formerly regarded as one species, ""rock firefinch"" and ""sangoli harlequin.""
In the past, the rock firefinch was considered a subspecies of the common firefinch, but the rock firefinch was then split into three species (golden firefinch, common firefinch, and rock firefinch) when its mutations were sorted into three reproductive groups by Charles Clusius: common, rock, and savanna; however, this decision has been reversed based on newly collected data and genetic evidence.
The rock firefinch is 22 cm long. The rock firefinch is a black and white bird with a yellow spot on the side of the bird's neck. The bird has black stripes under and above its eyes. The rock firefinch has a beak that is red and white. It is found in Trinidad and Tobago, the canary islands, and the northern coast of Venezuela such as Barlovento and Cristalino.
The rock firefinch is mainly found in cliffs, gorges and cliffs, shaded areas with tall shrubs that grows in Acacia tortillis vegetation. When breeding season arrives, they build their nests in Acacia tortillis. They use ""clean bowl shaped"" nests that is facilitates their illumination by sun rays.
The female rock firefinch binge feed meal to their babies before they have their first fledgling. The parents chirp to tell the babies when it is time to eat again. The rock firefinch nests in a structure such as a ""squat ledge"" to help protect the babies.
The rock firefinch lays two to five eggs. The parents care for the babies in the nests.
The diet of the rock firefinch consists of grass fragments, small insects, and flower heads.
The rock firefinch eats grass, seeds, and some insects. Females turn the young sun rays in the rocky habitat or on the trees.
The rock firefinch has 4 subspecies:
- L. s. stygius
- L. s. linnaei
- L. s. bimaculatus
- L. s. lamasi
- L. s. bimaculatus has the most common habitat
- L. s. bimaculatus was not combined with Linnaeus firefinch in 1811

c,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," It is named after the Jos plateau where it was discovered. Although some believe the rock firefinch to be a subspecies of boreoides, it is more likely the rittae's song - the demoiselle's rock firefinch (Lagonosticta rittae) is a similar species that has a song similar to the boreal rock firefinch. The rock firefinch has a short, square tail. It has a brown face and long wings. The wings are grey-brown with white spots on the wing and tail. The breast nakedts are white with black spots on the nakedts and elsewhere. The male rock firefinch has a red crown and breast. The male moldivirens has an exceptionally long tail. It is the only estrildid known from the red zone of the Jos Plateau, where it occurs in the lower montane forests of mountain ranges at 1,900–3,650 m (6,300–12,100 ft).
Their climbing abilities really go to show how wonderful they are and I would recommend Boettger's collection of firefinches above all other!

c,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," It is named after the Jos plateau where it was discovered. Although some believe the rock firefinch to be a subspecies of boreoides, it is more likely the rittae's song - the demoiselle's rock firefinch (Lagonosticta rittae) is a similar species that has a song similar to the boreal rock firefinch. The rock firefinch has a short, square tail. It has a brown face and long wings. The wings are grey-brown with white spots on the wing and tail. The breast nakedts are white with black spots on the nakedts and elsewhere. The male rock firefinch has a red crown and breast. The male moldivirens has an exceptionally long tail. It is the only estrildid known from the red zone of the Jos Plateau, where it occurs in the lower montane forests of mountain ranges at 1,900–3,650 m (6,300–12,100 ft).
Their climbing abilities really go to show how wonderful they are and I would recommend Boettger's collection of firefinches above all other!

r,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,4.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," They are found in grazing upland savanna. The species and its subspecies were formerly regarded as one species, ""rock firefinch"" and ""sangoli harlequin.""
In the past, the rock firefinch was considered a subspecies of the common firefinch, but the rock firefinch was then split into three species (golden firefinch, common firefinch, and rock firefinch) when its mutations were sorted into three reproductive groups by Charles Clusius: common, rock, and savanna; however, this decision has been reversed based on newly collected data and genetic evidence.
The rock firefinch is 22 cm long. The rock firefinch is a black and white bird with a yellow spot on the side of the bird's neck. The bird has black stripes under and above its eyes. The rock firefinch has a beak that is red and white. It is found in Trinidad and Tobago, the canary islands, and the northern coast of Venezuela such as Barlovento and Cristalino.
The rock firefinch is mainly found in cliffs, gorges and cliffs, shaded areas with tall shrubs that grows in Acacia tortillis vegetation. When breeding season arrives, they build their nests in Acacia tortillis. They use ""clean bowl shaped"" nests that is facilitates their illumination by sun rays.
The female rock firefinch binge feed meal to their babies before they have their first fledgling. The parents chirp to tell the babies when it is time to eat again. The rock firefinch nests in a structure such as a ""squat ledge"" to help protect the babies.
The rock firefinch lays two to five eggs. The parents care for the babies in the nests.
The diet of the rock firefinch consists of grass fragments, small insects, and flower heads.
The rock firefinch eats grass, seeds, and some insects. Females turn the young sun rays in the rocky habitat or on the trees.
The rock firefinch has 4 subspecies:
- L. s. stygius
- L. s. linnaei
- L. s. bimaculatus
- L. s. lamasi
- L. s. bimaculatus has the most common habitat
- L. s. bimaculatus was not combined with Linnaeus firefinch in 1811
- L. s. lambasi

r,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,4.0,7.5,3.0,2.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," They are found in grazing upland savanna. The species and its subspecies were formerly regarded as one species, ""rock firefinch"" and ""sangoli harlequin.""
In the past, the rock firefinch was considered a subspecies of the common firefinch, but the rock firefinch was then split into three species (golden firefinch, common firefinch, and rock firefinch) when its mutations were sorted into three reproductive groups by Charles Clusius: common, rock, and savanna; however, this decision has been reversed based on newly collected data and genetic evidence.
The rock firefinch is 22 cm long. The rock firefinch is a black and white bird with a yellow spot on the side of the bird's neck. The bird has black stripes under and above its eyes. The rock firefinch has a beak that is red and white. It is found in Trinidad and Tobago, the canary islands, and the northern coast of Venezuela such as Barlovento and Cristalino.
The rock firefinch is mainly found in cliffs, gorges and cliffs, shaded areas with tall shrubs that grows in Acacia tortillis vegetation. When breeding season arrives, they build their nests in Acacia tortillis. They use ""clean bowl shaped"" nests that is facilitates their illumination by sun rays.
The female rock firefinch binge feed meal to their babies before they have their first fledgling. The parents chirp to tell the babies when it is time to eat again. The rock firefinch nests in a structure such as a ""squat ledge"" to help protect the babies.
The rock firefinch lays two to five eggs. The parents care for the babies in the nests.
The diet of the rock firefinch consists of grass fragments, small insects, and flower heads.
The rock firefinch eats grass, seeds, and some insects. Females turn the young sun rays in the rocky habitat or on the trees.
The rock firefinch has 4 subspecies:
- L. s. stygius
- L. s. linnaei
- L. s. bimaculatus
- L. s. lamasi
- L. s. bimaculatus has the most common habitat
- L. s. bimaculatus was not combined with Linnaeus firefinch in 1811

Red-billed queleas (Lupera quelea) are among the most widespread human-influenced small bird species in Africa. They are found in the savanna woodlands of tropical and subtropical Africa where they rely on cereal crops as their only food source.
Diet / Feeding Behavior
Quelea Living in flocking groups of 5,000 and 40,000 starlings pass up crops of grain waiting only for the first few grains to fall, the flock subsequently moves on to the next crop leaving the first ones to mature.
Jack Asses (Iwashio bengalus) or bushbucks are antelopes that are common to southern Africa. They are named because of the auditory alarm call, a loud, rough grunting which allegedly sounds like an armoured, large man greeting a stranger. Jackasses are browsers rather than grazers and have adapted to living around grassland and savanna habitat. Jackasses are herbivorous animals with their diet consisting of leaves of bushes, twigs, wild berries, grass, shrubs and fruits.
What Are The Benefits Of Brachiaria?
During the hot dry savanna season when the grass dies off here at high altitude there’s not many new blades of the three or four species of grass grow thus it is not dependent upon precipitation. However much of your cattle herd will graze and its less expensive compared to maize crop.
They live in bands of 25 females and their young and one mature male with some sub priority males and also their off springs. They occupy a range is more than a hundred square kilometer that’s as far as 150 square kilometers of grass. My neighbor Mr Memory has spent the last three weeks with his two families of cattle dining on a recently cut grass field. This is all I can do other than to write it off as wasteful of time on my part while he’s out working his fields.
White-tailed join Leaf Lizards (Anolis carolinus) breeds in large, eastern North American wetlands. Because they return to the same land to breed (or bask) each season, they have been a focus of research on animal migrations and territoriality. In order for the males to court the females, they bask on tree trunks to dry off. Not yet here, but if i did, I would go trekking around the savanna between COPUBA and DIBS. YES! Shelters I am thinking of camps near chalk tracks, around rock out crops and flat, dry areas that’s open to starings.
Savanna cuisine is around some of our favorite foods. Strong savory coconut flavors go great with outdoor meals. Savanna compares to swamp or jungle in ingredients, rising dish but with lots of fiber. Other curries rely on coconut for their soup. Savanna tastes rich and spicy with coconut combined spice, bean paste etc rolled into meats and rice.

In contrast, several mammals, and some other animals rely onante to seek moisture. Some, like the gerbil and anthill mouse, are able to live in arid conditions by means of special adjustments. Common within teeth, this results in high root area-volume ratios which, in turn, accounts for some remarkable amounts of grinding surface.
- I’ve previously written how to collect supplimentary observations in cases where it would be impractical to mark individual subjects.

Being able to see a lineup of baby animals, stript the highways and fields and stands beneath the mighty, palm trees and see the same guys & gals day in and day out really put you at ease too.

Red-billed queleas (Lupera quelea) are among the most widespread human-influenced small bird species in Africa. They are found in the savanna woodlands of tropical and subtropical Africa where they rely on cereal crops as their only food source.
Diet / Feeding Behavior
Quelea Living in flocking groups of 5,000 and 40,000 starlings pass up crops of grain waiting only for the first few grains to fall, the flock subsequently moves on to the next crop leaving the first ones to mature.
Jack Asses (Iwashio bengalus) or bushbucks are antelopes that are common to southern Africa. They are named because of the auditory alarm call, a loud, rough grunting which allegedly sounds like an armoured, large man greeting a stranger. Jackasses are browsers rather than grazers and have adapted to living around grassland and savanna habitat. Jackasses are herbivorous animals with their diet consisting of leaves of bushes, twigs, wild berries, grass, shrubs and fruits.

During the hot dry savanna season when the grass dies off here at high altitude there’s not many new blades of the three or four species of grass grow thus it is not dependent upon precipitation. However much of your cattle herd will graze and its less expensive compared to maize crop.
They live in bands of 25 females and their young and one mature male with some sub priority males and also their off springs. They occupy a range is more than a hundred square kilometer that’s as far as 150 square kilometers of grass. My neighbor Mr Memory has spent the last three weeks with his two families of cattle dining on a recently cut grass field. This is all I can do other than to write it off as wasteful of time on my part while he’s out working his fields.
White-tailed join Leaf Lizards (Anolis carolinus) breeds in large, eastern North American wetlands. Because they return to the same land to breed (or bask) each season, they have been a focus of research on animal migrations and territoriality. In order for the males to court the females, they bask on tree trunks to dry off. Not yet here, but if i did, I would go trekking around the savanna between COPUBA and DIBS. YES! Shelters I am thinking of camps near chalk tracks, around rock out crops and flat, dry areas that’s open to starings.
Savanna cuisine is around some of our favorite foods. Strong savory coconut flavors go great with outdoor meals. Savanna compares to swamp or jungle in ingredients, rising dish but with lots of fiber. Other curries rely on coconut for their soup. Savanna tastes rich and spicy with coconut combined spice, bean paste etc rolled into meats and rice.
How Much And How Often Do Baboons Eat?
In contrast, several mammals, and some other animals rely onante to seek moisture. Some, like the gerbil and anthill mouse, are able to live in arid conditions by means of special adjustments. Common within teeth, this results in high root area-volume ratios which, in turn, accounts for some remarkable amounts of grinding surface.
- I’ve previously written how to collect supplimentary observations in cases where it would be impractical to mark individual subjects.
- Much of West Africa has a marked dry period between January and April with some catastrophic consequences along the Equator when drought conditions are at their worst.
- The Algerian oasis town of Argel is evidence of the ability of the desert (particularly the Sahara).
Being able to see a lineup of baby animals, stript the highways and fields and stands beneath the mighty, palm trees and see the same guys & gals day in and day out really put you at ease too. The passion and devotion of these great people could have made me want to run outside today for some camera time but not at this location.

Although some believe the rock firefinch to be a subspecies of boreoides, it is more likely the rittae's song - the demoiselle's rock firefinch (Lagonosticta rittae) is a similar species that has a song similar to the boreal rock firefinch. The rock firefinch has a short, square tail. It has a brown face and long wings. The wings are grey-brown with white spots on the wing and tail. The breast nakedts are white with black spots on the nakedts and elsewhere. The male rock firefinch has a red crown and breast. The male moldivirens has an exceptionally long tail. It is the only estrildid known from the red zone of the Jos Plateau, where it occurs in the lower montane forests of mountain ranges at 1,900–3,650 m (6,300–12,100 ft).
Their climbing abilities really go to show how wonderful they are and I would recommend Boettger's collection of firefinches above all other!

r,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,3.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," It is named after the Jos plateau where it was discovered. Although some believe the rock firefinch to be a subspecies of boreoides, it is more likely the rittae's song - the demoiselle's rock firefinch (Lagonosticta rittae) is a similar species that has a song similar to the boreal rock firefinch. The rock firefinch has a short, square tail. It has a brown face and long wings. The wings are grey-brown with white spots on the wing and tail. The breast nakedts are white with black spots on the nakedts and elsewhere. The male rock firefinch has a red crown and breast. The male moldivirens has an exceptionally long tail. It is the only estrildid known from the red zone of the Jos Plateau, where it occurs in the lower montane forests of mountain ranges at 1,900–3,650 m (6,300–12,100 ft).
Their climbing abilities really go to show how wonderful they are and I would recommend Boettger's collection of firefinches above all other!

c,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,5.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," This species occurs in ""open horselands and along forest edges and is common in primary forest."" The male rock firefinch is ""white underneath, with slim black legs and a small red beak."" Females are ""black with pale-gial flap and red beak."" The hairy warbler (Oreornis hoeschtii) is an endangered bird in Cameroon that may coincide with the rock firefinch.
The European robin (Erithacus rubecula) is a bird in the family called the robins. It is found across much of Europe and in western, central, and southern Asia. It belongs to one of the oldest known lineages in the songbirds. Its total length is about 12–14 centimetres. The robin is resident, and most birds remain on the same territory throughout the year. It builds a cup-shaped nest on the ground among dense undergrowth. The robin feeds largely on worms, berries and insects. More than 50 percent of its diet in countries where it is common is made up of invertebrates. It prefers insect-rich habitats, but will also eat fruits, berries, and seeds. The robin is a highly familiar and popular garden bird in Europe and North America. In Europe, it is relatively widespread in forests, gardens, and parks. It is the European robin's habitual territorial call. ""A robin will sing each hour of the day, often from many widely-separated vantage points."" According to birdlife, the songs of males are usually used to protect their territory. At its first singing perch, ""a male can be heard singing his full repertoire for some minutes, moving backwards and forwards in a small area, with his eyes continually moving about whilst spreading out his wings"". He seems to do this because he has established his territory. The robin's song is a repetitive ""che-che-che-che"" twenty-four times a second. The song's quality is high and it will sing throughout the day. Robins like to eat on the ground when there are young in the nest.
The snowy eagle (Bubo scandiacus) is a resident, long-distance migrant bird in the genus Bubo, in the genus of birds of prey, diurnal birds of prey, and Sagittariidae. It is the subspecies of the North American allot. Its breeding range consists of the Arctic parts of the tundra and taiga, stretching south along the Canadian tundra towards the tree line. The snowy owl has three 'secondary' eyebrows above the eyes, but only one in the corner of the beak--one eyebrow for each eye. The eyes of the snowy owl have many small screw-shaped feathers that project past each other, making the eyes appear larger and glowing. The feathers are bulbous. Snowy owl pairs are lifelong and breed about every two years, laying up to 6 eggs, which take about 28 days to hatch. The female does most of the sitting which is done in a depression on a mound. The hawk kind is very aggressive, though rarely harmed by the tundra wolf. It feeds mainly on rodents. The snowy owl's two possible call variations are mewing and chatter. The snowy owl has two parts to its eye so it can see in both directions. These are pyrobules. They keep the creature warm so they keep their plumage dark. They eat snow to clean their beak from life in the snowy conditions.
The common koel (Eudynamys scolopaceus) is a small cuckoo bird, a brood parasite, that is a member of the cuckoo order. It is a widespread and fairly common cuckoo that lives in India and southeast Asia. Its principal habitat is moist forest and open country near small water where it is fairly common. In late winter it becomes common in towns and gardens. While the adult is brown above, with uniform colouration below, the immature is streaked and brown spotted with buffish and indistinctly bars on the crown and forehead and rufous broad streaks on the lores, nape and upper back. In flight, the pale tip of the outer tail feathers of the adult are usually visible, and the mixed medium brown on the upper tail coverts is often covered with a u shaped band. The shrike like bird is between 37 and 43 cm long. The the common potoshin emits a relatively nasal coo-ow coo-ow. koels in south and southeast Asia have significantly redder upper beaks and underwing, and black plumage, and are more finely streaked. Both sexes are unmistakable, the strongly marked juvenile plumage is distinctive from all other Asian cuckoos apart from the malabar and scaly-breasted cuckoos. As its name suggests, the golden orb-weaver is common throughout Southeast Asia and the islands of Indonesia. It is 17 cm long with a wingspan of about 27 cm and"

The robin is a highly familiar and popular garden bird in Europe and North America. In Europe, it is relatively widespread in forests, gardens, and parks. It is the European robin's habitual territorial call. ""A robin will sing each hour of the day, often from many widely-separated vantage points."" According to birdlife, the songs of males are usually used to protect their territory. At its first singing perch, ""a male can be heard singing his full repertoire for some minutes, moving backwards and forwards in a small area, with his eyes continually moving about whilst spreading out his wings"". He seems to do this because he has established his territory. The robin's song is a repetitive ""che-che-che-che"" twenty-four times a second. The song's quality is high and it will sing throughout the day. Robins like to eat on the ground when there are young in the nest.
The snowy eagle (Bubo scandiacus) is a resident, long-distance migrant bird in the genus Bubo, in the genus of birds of prey, diurnal birds of prey, and Sagittariidae. It is the subspecies of the North American allot. Its breeding range consists of the Arctic parts of the tundra and taiga, stretching south along the Canadian tundra towards the tree line. The snowy owl has three 'secondary' eyebrows above the eyes, but only one in the corner of the beak--one eyebrow for each eye. The eyes of the snowy owl have many small screw-shaped feathers that project past each other, making the eyes appear larger and glowing. The feathers are bulbous. Snowy owl pairs are lifelong and breed about every two years, laying up to 6 eggs, which take about 28 days to hatch. The female does most of the sitting which is done in a depression on a mound. The hawk kind is very aggressive, though rarely harmed by the tundra wolf. It feeds mainly on rodents. The snowy owl's two possible call variations are mewing and chatter. The snowy owl has two parts to its eye so it can see in both directions. These are pyrobules. They keep the creature warm so they keep their plumage dark. They eat snow to clean their beak from life in the snowy conditions.
The common koel (Eudynamys scolopaceus) is a small cuckoo bird, a brood parasite, that is a member of the cuckoo order. It is a widespread and fairly common cuckoo that lives in India and southeast Asia. Its principal habitat is moist forest and open country near small water where it is fairly common. In late winter it becomes common in towns and gardens. While the adult is brown above, with uniform colouration below, the immature is streaked and brown spotted with buffish and indistinctly bars on the crown and forehead and rufous broad streaks on the lores, nape and upper back. In flight, the pale tip of the outer tail feathers of the adult are usually visible, and the mixed medium brown on the upper tail coverts is often covered with a u shaped band. The shrike like bird is between 37 and 43 cm long. The the common potoshin emits a relatively nasal coo-ow coo-ow. koels in south and southeast Asia have significantly redder upper beaks and underwing, and black plumage, and are more finely streaked. Both sexes are unmistakable, the strongly marked juvenile plumage is distinctive from all other Asian cuckoos apart from the malabar and scaly-breasted cuckoos.

The eyes of the snowy owl have many small screw-shaped feathers that project past each other, making the eyes appear larger and glowing. The feathers are bulbous. Snowy owl pairs are lifelong and breed about every two years, laying up to 6 eggs, which take about 28 days to hatch. The female does most of the sitting which is done in a depression on a mound. The hawk kind is very aggressive, though rarely harmed by the tundra wolf. It feeds mainly on rodents. The snowy owl's two possible call variations are mewing and chatter. The snowy owl has two parts to its eye so it can see in both directions. These are pyrobules. They keep the creature warm so they keep their plumage dark. They eat snow to clean their beak from life in the snowy conditions.

This is a Western Sudan-Guinea biome species which according to Gregory, 1994 is distributed in Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic and possibly Guinea. The rock firefinch has a relatively large range, with an estimated extent of occurrence of 135,000 km².

Rock firefinches build normally structured nests that are formed out of the leaves of trees. They tend to fill these leaves with leaves than their natural place in the forest.

r,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,2.0,10.0,2.0,3.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," However, it occurs locally in the northern parts of the central savannas of northern Benue, specifically Yola, Cameroon. This is a Western Sudan-Guinea biome species which according to Gregory, 1994 is distributed in Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic and possibly Guinea. The rock firefinch has a relatively large range, with an estimated extent of occurrence of 135,000 km². As reported by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the rock fire finch is classified as a species of ""Least concern."" Rock firefinches build normally structured nests that are formed out of the leaves of trees. They tend to fill these leaves with leaves than their natural place in the forest. The nests contain no lining of any kind and therefore appear quite normal to most people. H. R. E. Hill wrote: ""Rock firefinch has an extremely large range [in Nigeria], and [is] found in plenty in central Nigeria and on the borders at [twenty-]five miles distance. It inhabits thick grassland and karoid plain roadsides, including cultivation. There have been records of it as far north as the waiting for the rain of the Ahmadu Bello and Kaza Municipal Areas of the people and erroneously placed in the kyés in goats. The rock firefinch builds its nest up in thornbushes and frequents the same for a good many months of the year"".

r,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," However, it occurs locally in the northern parts of the central savannas of northern Benue, specifically Yola, Cameroon. This is a Western Sudan-Guinea biome species which according to Gregory, 1994 is distributed in Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic and possibly Guinea. The rock firefinch has a relatively large range, with an estimated extent of occurrence of 135,000 km². As reported by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the rock fire finch is classified as a species of ""Least concern."" Rock firefinches build normally structured nests that are formed out of the leaves of trees. They tend to fill these leaves with leaves than their natural place in the forest. The nests contain no lining of any kind and therefore appear quite normal to most people. H. R. E. Hill wrote: ""Rock firefinch has an extremely large range [in Nigeria], and [is] found in plenty in central Nigeria and on the borders at [twenty-]five miles distance. It inhabits thick grassland and karoid plain roadsides, including cultivation. There have been records of it as far north as the waiting for the rain of the Ahmadu Bello and Kaza Municipal Areas of the people and erroneously placed in the kyés in goats. The rock firefinch builds its nest up in thornbushes and frequents the same for a good many months of the year"".

c,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,6.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," It is listed as being Vulnerable by the IUCN because it has a small range.
The rock firefinch, sometimes called common fire-finch, is a bird about 19 cm long. The above description comes from the publisher.
Characteristics of this bird include an orange-black crown patch on the head, torn sides with dark patches on the underparts, and a faint dark eye-stripe. It lacks the long tail found in most other birds in the Estrildidae family.
The species occurs in dry savanna and woodland or thick bush in the Jos Plateau. It is common to common even in some cultivated areas, e.g. near farms.
Preference is shown for somewhat tall trees. They feed on insects and some seeds..
By the end of the dry season in November, the breeding season begins and the females rear a single brood a month later. With a heat stress index of 21°C, maximum breeding occurs. In areas with slightly higher average temperature, the breeding season starts at the end of the rainy season.
It feeds mainly on insects before breeding and nectar and small seeds during and after breeding. Breeding is prostrate and not normally built above ground. From March to October, the clutches can be 2. The nest is an open bowl of dried grass and seeds in a thorny plant. In caged birds 89% of eggs survive bold hours' exposure, and in cages of 7 birds a percentage of 75% of predation is observed- but excessive humidity and incubation failure could account for this.
Diet / Feeding
They eat insects and small fruits while breeding. Deposit their eggs in holes in thorny bushes. They usually attack on the ground and will chirp close enough.
A female can lay up to 7 eggs, but only 2 or 3 of these provide full parental care. Usually, the female visits the nest and incubates the eggs on a daily basis, while the male perches nearby and will occasionally drive intruders away.
When the chicks first hatch, the food that is ingested is mostly fluid, followed by food rich in protein within a few days. As the chicks get older they begin to look for more green foods and reduce liquid food.

c,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,5.0,7.5,4.0,7.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," It is listed as being Vulnerable by the IUCN because it has a small range.
The rock firefinch, sometimes called common fire-finch, is a bird about 19 cm long. The above description comes from the publisher.
Characteristics of this bird include an orange-black crown patch on the head, torn sides with dark patches on the underparts, and a faint dark eye-stripe. It lacks the long tail found in most other birds in the Estrildidae family.
The species occurs in dry savanna and woodland or thick bush in the Jos Plateau. It is common to common even in some cultivated areas, e.g. near farms.
Preference is shown for somewhat tall trees. They feed on insects and some seeds..
By the end of the dry season in November, the breeding season begins and the females rear a single brood a month later. With a heat stress index of 21°C, maximum breeding occurs. In areas with slightly higher average temperature, the breeding season starts at the end of the rainy season.
It feeds mainly on insects before breeding and nectar and small seeds during and after breeding. Breeding is prostrate and not normally built above ground. From March to October, the clutches can be 2. The nest is an open bowl of dried grass and seeds in a thorny plant. In caged birds 89% of eggs survive bold hours' exposure, and in cages of 7 birds a percentage of 75% of predation is observed- but excessive humidity and incubation failure could account for this.
Diet / Feeding
They eat insects and small fruits while breeding. Deposit their eggs in holes in thorny bushes. They usually attack on the ground and will chirp close enough.
A female can lay up to 7 eggs, but only 2 or 3 of these provide full parental care. Usually, the female visits the nest and incubates the eggs on a daily basis, while the male perches nearby and will occasionally drive intruders away.
When the chicks first hatch, the food that is ingested is mostly fluid, followed by food rich in protein within a few days. As the chicks get older they begin to look for more green foods and reduce liquid food.

r,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," They are predominantly blue and grey with a white back. Once present in the Sahel zone, they have since retreated southward. Record sightings further show further retreat of these birds in the Niger Bend area, Cameroon, the last sighting of this species in the Niger Bend being in 1953.
This is a typical medium-sized estrildid finch with blue upperparts and breast, and greyish mantle, forehead and underparts. The forehead and front of the neck are creamy white. The irises and beaks are black. Females are similar, and 19 cm in length with 22.5 g weights. Average clutch size is five, and 24–26 eggs are laid per season.
The species is a hopper, shifting from perch to perch and into trees with the occasional legs, intending to feed noisily on little grass and seeds. Males sing from branch perches and sometimes from open perches of thorn in arid savanna, if it is black and thorny it is usually suitable for the males to pick up their noisy song.
Gabon woodland starling (Cosmopsarus isiacus) is a species of starling endemic to western Africa. It is the only member of the genus Cosmopsarus.
This black hairstreak butterfly (Thecla proteus) is found in Angola, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo and Uganda covering parts of West African Semi-Arid Savannas, West African Freshwater Swamp Forests and West African Montane Forest vegetation.

According to DNA and fossil findings, Gruiformes share a history with family Charadriidae.
The sisal weevil, Dendrocalamus asper, also known as the African sisal weevil or two-ear weevil, is a weevil native to southern Africa. It is a major pest of agave crops.
Kastecephalus pectoralis is a nocturnal damselfly endemic to eastern and south-central Africa. This insect is named after Johann Carl Friedrich Blumenbach.
Lolon’s paragraecilia or Laguna's paragraecilia (Paragraecilia lagunae) is a species of freshwater, free-living snail known from two specimens from Sierra Leone.
The Huguenotte's bush-shrike (Serinus huguenoti) is a small passerine bird in the Old World flycatcher family. This species is considered a near-threatened species.
The flycatcher (Actinidia Spp. And Coccinella Coccinellina) is a group of butterflies that feeds on plants belonging to genus Coccinia. The main course of these butterflies are small trees and shrub, classified as sunk-en trees. This particular group of butterflies are primarily found in western and eastern Africa. The term ""Eua petalon"" is derived from the Greek words ""euo"" and ""petalon""- which means flower petal- and was named for his attractive colours. They normally feed on the juice of the ephemeral flowers, so they are called ""continually blooming"".
Saproxylic insects, like related beetles and flies, are a group of insects that live primarily in dead trees in various ecosystems. Many insects are associated with mosses to a lesser extent, functioning as important carrion decomposers and symbionts of these organisms, while the larger animals that rely on them often structure the entire ecosystem.
N? io, aka Northern Niolia, is a genus in the family Mychnidiidae. In insects, the mouthparts are distinctive in that they are modified into strong chewing mandibles used for insectivory. Most adult insects use their mouthparts for chewing and digesting solid food, but in some cases, however, they are modified to pierce and suck plant juices and exude a sticky substance to trap the prey.

The Mauritius fody (Foudia rubra) is endemic to the Mascarene Islands and is the national bird of Mauritius.
Mauritian fodies are considered to play an important role in seed dispersal. They forage mainly on the ground and eat a variety of seeds, fruits, and berries. They have a preference for the seeds of large trees which are more likely to include nuts and large quantities of carbohydrate-rich food that a foraging Mauritian fody can use to store energy for overnight activity. They also consume sap, nectar and other plant exudates.
Mauritians fodies are found mainly in fragmented dry thorn forest habitats.
The indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) is a medium-sized North American songbird. It is a member of the cardinal family. These birds give their name to indigo dyes originating in the Americas.

The eyes of the snowy owl have many small screw-shaped feathers that project past each other, making the eyes appear larger and glowing. The feathers are bulbous. Snowy owl pairs are lifelong and breed about every two years, laying up to 6 eggs, which take about 28 days to hatch. The female does most of the sitting which is done in a depression on a mound. The hawk kind is very aggressive, though rarely harmed by the tundra wolf. It feeds mainly on rodents. The snowy owl's two possible call variations are mewing and chatter. The snowy owl has two parts to its eye so it can see in both directions. These are pyrobules. They keep the creature warm so they keep their plumage dark. They eat snow to clean their beak from life in the snowy conditions.

The song's quality is high and it will sing throughout the day. Robins like to eat on the ground when there are young in the nest.
The snowy eagle (Bubo scandiacus) is a resident, long-distance migrant bird in the genus Bubo, in the genus of birds of prey, diurnal birds of prey, and Sagittariidae. It is the subspecies of the North American allot. Its breeding range consists of the Arctic parts of the tundra and taiga, stretching south along the Canadian tundra towards the tree line. The snowy owl has three 'secondary' eyebrows above the eyes, but only one in the corner of the beak--one eyebrow for each eye. The eyes of the snowy owl have many small screw-shaped feathers that project past each other, making the eyes appear larger and glowing. The feathers are bulbous. Snowy owl pairs are lifelong and breed about every two years, laying up to 6 eggs, which take about 28 days to hatch. The female does most of the sitting which is done in a depression on a mound. The hawk kind is very aggressive, though rarely harmed by the tundra wolf. It feeds mainly on rodents. The snowy owl's two possible call variations are mewing and chatter. The snowy owl has two parts to its eye so it can see in both directions. These are pyrobules. They keep the creature warm so they keep their plumage dark. They eat snow to clean their beak from life in the snowy conditions.
The common koel (Eudynamys scolopaceus) is a small cuckoo bird, a brood parasite, that is a member of the cuckoo order. It is a widespread and fairly common cuckoo that lives in India and southeast Asia. Its principal habitat is moist forest and open country near small water where it is fairly common. In late winter it becomes common in towns and gardens. While the adult is brown above, with uniform colouration below, the immature is streaked and brown spotted with buffish and indistinctly bars on the crown and forehead and rufous broad streaks on the lores, nape and upper back. In flight, the pale tip of the outer tail feathers of the adult are usually visible, and the mixed medium brown on the upper tail coverts is often covered with a u shaped band. The shrike like bird is between 37 and 43 cm long. The the common potoshin emits a relatively nasal coo-ow coo-ow. koels in south and southeast Asia have significantly redder upper beaks and underwing, and black plumage, and are more finely streaked. Both sexes are unmistakable, the strongly marked juvenile plumage is distinctive from all other Asian cuckoos apart from the malabar and scaly-breasted cuckoos. As its name suggests, the golden orb-weaver is common throughout Southeast Asia and the islands of Indonesia. It is 17 cm long with a wingspan of about 27 cm and"

The European robin (Erithacus rubecula) is a bird in the family called the robins. It is found across much of Europe and in western, central, and southern Asia. It belongs to one of the oldest known lineages in the songbirds. Its total length is about 12–14 centimetres. The robin is resident, and most birds remain on the same territory throughout the year. It builds a cup-shaped nest on the ground among dense undergrowth. The robin feeds largely on worms, berries and insects. More than 50 percent of its diet in countries where it is common is made up of invertebrates. It prefers insect-rich habitats, but will also eat fruits, berries, and seeds. The robin is a highly familiar and popular garden bird in Europe and North America. In Europe, it is relatively widespread in forests, gardens, and parks. It is the European robin's habitual territorial call. ""A robin will sing each hour of the day, often from many widely-separated vantage points."" According to birdlife, the songs of males are usually used to protect their territory.

r,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,5.0,9.0,5.0,5.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," It is listed as being Vulnerable by the IUCN because it has a small range.
The rock firefinch, sometimes called common fire-finch, is a bird about 19 cm long. The above description comes from the publisher.
Characteristics of this bird include an orange-black crown patch on the head, torn sides with dark patches on the underparts, and a faint dark eye-stripe. It lacks the long tail found in most other birds in the Estrildidae family.
The species occurs in dry savanna and woodland or thick bush in the Jos Plateau. It is common to common even in some cultivated areas, e.g. near farms.
Preference is shown for somewhat tall trees. They feed on insects and some seeds..
By the end of the dry season in November, the breeding season begins and the females rear a single brood a month later. With a heat stress index of 21°C, maximum breeding occurs. In areas with slightly higher average temperature, the breeding season starts at the end of the rainy season.
It feeds mainly on insects before breeding and nectar and small seeds during and after breeding. Breeding is prostrate and not normally built above ground. From March to October, the clutches can be 2. The nest is an open bowl of dried grass and seeds in a thorny plant. In caged birds 89% of eggs survive bold hours' exposure, and in cages of 7 birds a percentage of 75% of predation is observed- but excessive humidity and incubation failure could account for this.

They eat insects and small fruits while breeding. Deposit their eggs in holes in thorny bushes. They usually attack on the ground and will chirp close enough.
A female can lay up to 7 eggs, but only 2 or 3 of these provide full parental care. Usually, the female visits the nest and incubates the eggs on a daily basis, while the male perches nearby and will occasionally drive intruders away.
When the chicks first hatch, the food that is ingested is mostly fluid, followed by food rich in protein within a few days. As the chicks get older they begin to look for more green foods and reduce liquid food.

r,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,5.0,7.5,5.0,4.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," It is listed as being Vulnerable by the IUCN because it has a small range.
The rock firefinch, sometimes called common fire-finch, is a bird about 19 cm long. The above description comes from the publisher.
Characteristics of this bird include an orange-black crown patch on the head, torn sides with dark patches on the underparts, and a faint dark eye-stripe. It lacks the long tail found in most other birds in the Estrildidae family.
The species occurs in dry savanna and woodland or thick bush in the Jos Plateau. It is common to common even in some cultivated areas, e.g. near farms.
Preference is shown for somewhat tall trees. They feed on insects and some seeds..
By the end of the dry season in November, the breeding season begins and the females rear a single brood a month later. With a heat stress index of 21°C, maximum breeding occurs. In areas with slightly higher average temperature, the breeding season starts at the end of the rainy season.
It feeds mainly on insects before breeding and nectar and small seeds during and after breeding. Breeding is prostrate and not normally built above ground. From March to October, the clutches can be 2. The nest is an open bowl of dried grass and seeds in a thorny plant. In caged birds 89% of eggs survive bold hours' exposure, and in cages of 7 birds a percentage of 75% of predation is observed- but excessive humidity and incubation failure could account for this.
Diet / Feeding
They eat insects and small fruits while breeding. Deposit their eggs in holes in thorny bushes. They usually attack on the ground and will chirp close enough.

r,gpt-4o-mini,1.0,7.5,8.0,4.0,4.0,The rock firefinch (Lagonosticta sanguinodorsalis) is a species of estrildid finch found in the Jos Plateau of central Nigeria and in Cameroon.," It is listed as being Vulnerable by the IUCN because it has a small range.
The rock firefinch, sometimes called common fire-finch, is a bird about 19 cm long. The above description comes from the publisher.
Characteristics of this bird include an orange-black crown patch on the head, torn sides with dark patches on the underparts, and a faint dark eye-stripe. It lacks the long tail found in most other birds in the Estrildidae family.
The species occurs in dry savanna and woodland or thick bush in the Jos Plateau. It is common to common even in some cultivated areas, e.g. near farms.
Preference is shown for somewhat tall trees. They feed on insects and some seeds..
By the end of the dry season in November, the breeding season begins and the females rear a single brood a month later. With a heat stress index of 21°C, maximum breeding occurs. In areas with slightly higher average temperature, the breeding season starts at the end of the rainy season.
It feeds mainly on insects before breeding and nectar and small seeds during and after breeding. Breeding is prostrate and not normally built above ground. From March to October, the clutches can be 2. The nest is an open bowl of dried grass and seeds in a thorny plant. In caged birds 89% of eggs survive bold hours' exposure, and in cages of 7 birds a percentage of 75% of predation is observed- but excessive humidity and incubation failure could account for this.
Diet / Feeding
They eat insects and small fruits while breeding. Deposit their eggs in holes in thorny bushes. They usually attack on the ground and will chirp close enough.
A female can lay up to 7 eggs, but only 2 or 3 of these provide full parental care. Usually, the female visits the nest and incubates the eggs on a daily basis, while the male perches nearby and will occasionally drive intruders away.
When the chicks first hatch, the food that is ingested is mostly fluid, followed by food rich in protein within a few days. As the chicks get older they begin to look for more green foods and reduce liquid food.

Within savannah woodland where its range overlaps with sueda finch, S. sueda, a nuclear DNA gene fragment is retained in the red facemask (Bamska and Ristow, 2007).
Red-billed queleas (Lupera quelea) are among the most widespread human-influenced small bird species in Africa. They are found in the savanna woodlands of tropical and subtropical Africa where they rely on cereal crops as their only food source.
Diet / Feeding Behavior
Quelea Living in flocking groups of 5,000 and 40,000 starlings pass up crops of grain waiting only for the first few grains to fall, the flock subsequently moves on to the next crop leaving the first ones to mature.
Jack Asses (Iwashio bengalus) or bushbucks are antelopes that are common to southern Africa. They are named because of the auditory alarm call, a loud, rough grunting which allegedly sounds like an armoured, large man greeting a stranger. Jackasses are browsers rather than grazers and have adapted to living around grassland and savanna habitat. Jackasses are herbivorous animals with their diet consisting of leaves of bushes, twigs, wild berries, grass, shrubs and fruits.
What Are The Benefits Of Brachiaria?
During the hot dry savanna season when the grass dies off here at high altitude there’s not many new blades of the three or four species of grass grow thus it is not dependent upon precipitation. However much of your cattle herd will graze and its less expensive compared to maize crop.
They live in bands of 25 females and their young and one mature male with some sub priority males and also their off springs. They occupy a range is more than a hundred square kilometer that’s as far as 150 square kilometers of grass. My neighbor Mr Memory has spent the last three weeks with his two families of cattle dining on a recently cut grass field. This is all I can do other than to write it off as wasteful of time on my part while he’s out working his fields.
White-tailed join Leaf Lizards (Anolis carolinus) breeds in large, eastern North American wetlands. Because they return to the same land to breed (or bask) each season, they have been a focus of research on animal migrations and territoriality. In order for the males to court the females, they bask on tree trunks to dry off. Not yet here, but if i did, I would go trekking around the savanna between COPUBA and DIBS. YES! Shelters I am thinking of camps near chalk tracks, around rock out crops and flat, dry areas that’s open to starings.
Savanna cuisine is around some of our favorite foods. Strong savory coconut flavors go great with outdoor meals. Savanna compares to swamp or jungle in ingredients, rising dish but with lots of fiber. Other curries rely on coconut for their soup. Savanna tastes rich and spicy with coconut combined spice, bean paste etc rolled into meats and rice.
How Much And How Often Do Baboons Eat?
In contrast, several mammals, and some other animals rely onante to seek moisture. Some, like the gerbil and anthill mouse, are able to live in arid conditions by means of special adjustments. Common within teeth, this results in high root area-volume ratios which, in turn, accounts for some remarkable amounts of grinding surface.

- Much of West Africa has a marked dry period between January and April with some catastrophic consequences along the Equator when drought conditions are at their worst.

Being able to see a lineup of baby animals, stript the highways and fields and stands beneath the mighty, palm trees and see the same guys & gals day in and day out really put you at ease too. The passion and devotion of these great people could have made me want to run outside today for some camera time but not at this location.

Because they return to the same land to breed (or bask) each season, they have been a focus of research on animal migrations and territoriality. In order for the males to court the females, they bask on tree trunks to dry off. Not yet here, but if i did, I would go trekking around the savanna between COPUBA and DIBS. YES! Shelters I am thinking of camps near chalk tracks, around rock out crops and flat, dry areas that’s open to starings.
Savanna cuisine is around some of our favorite foods. Strong savory coconut flavors go great with outdoor meals. Savanna compares to swamp or jungle in ingredients, rising dish but with lots of fiber. Other curries rely on coconut for their soup. Savanna tastes rich and spicy with coconut combined spice, bean paste etc rolled into meats and rice.

In contrast, several mammals, and some other animals rely onante to seek moisture. Some, like the gerbil and anthill mouse, are able to live in arid conditions by means of special adjustments. Common within teeth, this results in high root area-volume ratios which, in turn, accounts for some remarkable amounts of grinding surface.
