Use a damp soft cotton swab to remove any major corrosion deposits. Wear vinyl gloves while cleaning any battery corrosion. Make your cleaning agent by combine 1 tablespoon of baking soda with a teaspoon or so of water. Stir to make a paste. Apply the baking soda paste to the battery connections using a cotton swab or small piece of cloth. Once the baking soda is applied, you may see it bubble and foam, as it reacts with the corrosion.

Separate two eggs by cracking the shells on a flat surface, gently prying the broken shells apart, letting the whites slide through your fingers into one bowl while holding the unbroken yolks in your hand, to place in another bowl. Beat the yellow egg yolks together with a whisk, and add 1 1/2 cups milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1 cup melted butter. Whisk. Add the wet mixture into the dry mixture and whisk again. Use a stand mixer with the whisk attachment fitted to whisk the whites until they hold firm peaks, standing straight up when you remove the whisk. Using a silicone spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the flour mixture by placing one spoonful of egg whites at a time into the bowl, lifting some of the mixture over the whites and repeating this gently until the whites are completely mixed in and the mixture is light and fluffy. Take great care not to 'crunch' the mixture, pushing out air."}}, "resps": [[["-529.5765658025484", "False"]], [["-525.0182543559713", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-529.5765658025484", "False"], ["-525.0182543559713", "False"]], "doc_hash": "35ab212ad9a3c0e4de4ff50e5ca5671d4246bff260a96c5f3b9fcbfe1e0eb076", "prompt_hash": "1cb5ac80da2ee5f1a4e800e2da22711af3f5e05d5175c3e119ce9d5fd396ad0f", "target_hash": "6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b", "acc": 1.0, "acc_norm": 0.0}
